//! Hybrid spin+park barrier for worker-thread synchronisation.
//!
//! A fixed-party rendezvous point: each `wait()` caller blocks until
//! `parties` threads have arrived, then all release simultaneously and
//! the barrier is ready for the next round. Promoted from the Phase 0c
//! prototype (`threading_micro.rs`).
//!
//! See `wrk_docs/2026.04.17 - LLD - Threaded Dual-Core Phase 2 V4.md` §2.
//!
//! ## Mechanism
//!
//! A generation counter distinguishes barrier rounds. The last arriver
//! resets `count`, bumps `generation`, and broadcasts via `Condvar`.
//! Earlier arrivers first spin for a short budget (`SPIN_BUDGET`) — the
//! fast path when all workers converge within a few hundred ns — and
//! only then fall back to `Condvar::wait` so they don't burn CPU while
//! one productive worker runs a long quantum alone. This matters under
//! single-core workloads where three of four workers have nothing to
//! do: the pure-spin variant had them pegging `pause` for the entire
//! quantum, bouncing cache lines against the productive core.
//!
//! ## Poisoning
//!
//! If a worker panics before reaching the barrier, the remaining
//! threads would wait forever. The coordinator catches the panic
//! (Phase 4) and calls [`SpinBarrier::poison`], which unblocks all
//! current and future waiters with [`BarrierResult::Poisoned`] via the
//! same `Condvar` broadcast.
//!
//! ## Watchdog (Stage 5, HLD V1 §6.6)
//!
//! A worker that deadlocks *without* panicking — a PIO block stuck in
//! an infinite `JMP` loop, a CPU core polling an MMIO read that never
//! resolves — leaves the poison path untouched. Every `wait` call
//! therefore carries its own wall-clock deadline
//! ([`DEFAULT_DEADLINE`] unless constructed via [`SpinBarrier::with_deadline`]).
//! The spin loop checks `Instant::now()` every [`WATCHDOG_STRIDE`]
//! iterations and the park loop uses
//! [`Condvar::wait_timeout`](std::sync::Condvar::wait_timeout) with the
//! remaining budget, so expiry is detected promptly on both the hot
//! and cold paths. On expiry, the first waiter records the elapsed
//! time, flips [`SpinBarrier::timed_out`], and calls
//! [`SpinBarrier::poison`] so peer waiters wake into a
//! [`BarrierResult::TimedOut`] exit instead of a latent hang.
//!
//! Phase 0c measured ~425 ns mean round-trip (4-way) on the pure-spin
//! variant; the hybrid keeps that fast path when all workers arrive in
//! close succession.
//!
//! ## Cross-chip reuse
//!
//! This type is chip-agnostic and may move to `picoem-common` in
//! Phase 3 when the RP2040 threaded path lands.
