//! `SharedState` — the Arc bundle cloned into every worker in the
//! threaded runtime.
//!
//! Phase 3 Stage 4 (LLD V7 §3): scaffolding only. Stage 5 (`WorkerBus`)
//! consumes it; Stage 6's `ThreadedEmulator::from_emulator` constructs
//! it from the existing single-threaded `Emulator` / `Bus`.
//!
//! All inner state lives behind `Arc` so `SharedState: Clone` is a
//! cheap refcount bump. Cloning is the intended way to hand a view of
//! the shared state to each worker closure.
//!
//! The lock-free `master_cycle: Arc<AtomicU64>` lets the coordinator
//! publish cycle advancement without contending with the CPU workers'
//! PLL CS reads — see `bus/peripherals.rs` and LLD V7 §3/§4.
