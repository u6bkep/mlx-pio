Figure 6. The RP
processor subsystem
connects two
processors to the
system bus, peripheral
interrupts, GPIOs, and
a Serial Wire Debug
(SWD) connection
from an external
debug host. It also
contains closely-
coupled peripherals,
and peripherals used
for synchronisation
and communication,
which are collectively
referred to as the
single-cycle IO
subsystem (SIO).

## RP2350 is a symmetric dual-core system. Two cores operate simultaneously and independently, offering high

## processing throughput and the ability to route interrupts to different cores to improve throughput and latency of

## interrupt handling. The two cores have a symmetric view of the system bus; all memory resources on RP2350 are

## accessible equally on both cores, with the same performance.

## Each core has a pair of 32-bit AHB5 links to the system bus. One is used exclusively for instruction fetch, the other

## exclusively for load or store instructions and debugger access. Each core can perform one instruction fetch and one

## load or store access per cycle, provided there are no conflicts on the downstream bus ports.

## There are two sockets for cores to attach to the system bus, referred to as core 0 and core 1 throughout this datasheet.

## (They may synonymously be referred to as core0, core1, proc0 and proc1 in register documentation.) The processor

## plugged into each socket is selectable at boot time:

## • A Cortex-M33 processor, implementing the Armv8-M Main instruction set, plus extensions

## • A Hazard3 processor, implementing the RV32IMAC instruction set, plus extensions

## Cortex-M33 is the default option. Whichever processor is unused is held in reset with its clock gated at the top level.

## Unused processors use zero dynamic power. See Section 3.9 for information about the architecture selection hardware.

## The two Cortex-M33 instances are identical. They are configured with the Security, DSP and FPU extensions, as well as

## 8 × SAU regions, 8× Secure MPU regions and 8× Non-secure MPU regions. Section 3.7 documents the Cortex-M

## processor as well as the specific configuration used on RP2350. The two Hazard3 instances are also identical to one

## another; see Section 3.8 for the features and operation of the Hazard3 processors.

## Chapter 3. Processor subsystem 35

```
The Cortex-M33 implementation of the Armv8-M Security extension (also known as TrustZone-M) isolates trusted and
untrusted software running on-device. RP2350 extends the strict partitioning of the Arm Secure and Non-secure states
throughout the system, including the ability to assign peripherals, GPIOs and DMA channels to each security domain.
See Section 10.2 for a high-level overview of Armv8-M Security extension features in the context of the RP2350 security
architecture.
Not shown on Figure 6 are the coprocessors for the Cortex-M33. These are closely coupled to the core, offering a
transfer rate of 64 bits per cycle in and out of the Arm register file. You may consider them to be inside the Cortex-M
block on the diagram. RP2350 equips each Cortex-M33 with the following coprocessors:
```
- Coprocessor^0 : GPIO coprocessor (GPIOC), described in Section 3.6.
- Coprocessors^4 and^5 : Secure and Non-secure instances of the double-precision coprocessor (DCP), described in
    Section 3.6.
- Coprocessor^7 : redundancy coprocessor (RCP), described in Section 3.6.
An external debug host can access both cores over a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) bus. The host can:
- run, halt and reset the cores
- inspect internal core state such as registers
- access memory from the core’s point of view
- load code onto the device and run it
Section 3.5 describes the debug hardware in addition to the instruction trace hardware available on the Arm processors.
Peripherals throughout the system assert interrupt requests (IRQs) to demand attention from the processors. For
example, a UART peripheral asserts its interrupt when it has received a character, so the processor can collect it from
the receive FIFO. All interrupts route to both cores, and the core’s internal interrupt controller selects the interrupt
signals it wishes to subscribe to. Section 3.2 defines the system-level IRQ numbering as well as details of the Arm non-
maskable interrupt (NMI).
The event signals described in Section 3.3 are a mechanism for processors to sleep when waiting for other processors
in the system to complete a task or free up some resource. Each processor sees events emitted by the other processor.
They also see exclusivity events generated by the Global Exclusive Monitor described in Section 2.1.6, which is the piece
of hardware that allows the processors to safely manipulate shared variables using atomic read-modify-write
sequences.

## 3.1. SIO

The Single-cycle IO subsystem (SIO) contains peripherals that require low-latency, deterministic access from the
processors. It is accessed via the AHB Fabric. The SIO has a dedicated bus interface for each processor, as shown in
Figure 7.

Figure 7. The single-
cycle IO block
contains registers
which processors
must access quickly.
FIFOs, doorbells and
spinlocks support
message passing and
synchronisation
between the two
cores. The shared
GPIO registers provide
fast, direct access to
GPIO-capable pins.
Interpolators can
accelerate common
software tasks. Most
SIO hardware is
banked (duplicated)
for Secure and Non-
secure access. Grey
arrows show bus
connections for Non-
secure access.
The SIO contains:

- CPUID registers which read as 0/1 on core 0/1 (Section 3.1.2)
- Mailbox FIFOs for passing ordered messages between cores (Section 3.1.5)
- Doorbells for interrupting the opposite core on cumulative and unordered events (Section 3.1.6)
- Hardware spinlocks for implementing critical sections without using exclusive bus accesses (Section 3.1.4)
- Interpolators (Section 3.1.10) and TMDS encoders (Section 3.1.9)
- Standard RISC-V 64-bit platform timer (Section 3.1.8) which is usable by both Arm and RISC-V software
- GPIO registers for fast software bitbanging (Section 3.1.3), with shared access from both cores
Most SIO hardware is duplicated for Secure/Non-secure access. Non-secure access to the FIFO registers will see a
physically different FIFO than Secure access to the same address, so that messages belonging to Secure and Non-
secure software are not mixed: Section 3.1.1 describes this Secure/Non-secure banking in more detail.

#### 3.1.1. Secure and Non-secure SIO

```
To allow isolation of Secure and Non-secure software, whilst keeping a consistent programming model for software
written to run in either domain, the SIO is duplicated into a Secure and a Non-secure bank. Most hardware is duplicated
between the two banks, including:
```
- Mailbox FIFOs
- Doorbell registers
3.1. SIO 37

- Interrupt outputs to processors
- Spinlocks
For example, Non-secure code on core 0 can pass messages to Non-secure code on core 1 through the Non-secure
instance of the mailbox FIFO. In turn, this message will generate a Non-secure interrupt, which is separate from the
Secure FIFO interrupt line. This does not interfere with any Secure message passing that might be going on at the same
time, and Non-secure code can not snoop Secure messages because it does not have access to the Secure mailboxes.
The software running in the Secure and Non-secure domain can be identical, and the processors' bus accesses to the
SIO will automatically be routed to the Secure or Non-secure version of the mailbox registers.
The following hardware is not duplicated:
- The GPIO registers are shared, and Non-secure accesses are filtered on a per-GPIO basis by the Non-secure GPIO
mask defined in the ACCESSCTRL GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1 registers
- The RISC-V standard platform timer (MTIME, MTIMEH), which is also usable by Arm processors, is present only in
the Secure SIO, as it is a Machine-mode peripheral on RISC-V
- The interpolator and TMDS encoder peripherals are assignable to either the Secure or Non-secure SIO using the
PERI_NONSEC register
Accesses to the SIO register address range, starting at 0xd0000000 (SIO_BASE), are mapped to the SIO bank which
matches the security attribute of the bus access. This means accesses from the Arm Secure state, or RISC-V Machine
mode, will access the Secure SIO bank, and accesses from the Arm Non-secure state, or RISC-V User mode, will access
the Non-secure SIO bank.
Additionally, Secure accesses can use the mirrored address range starting at 0xd0020000 (SIO_NONSEC_BASE) to access
the Non-secure view of SIO, for example, using the Non-secure doorbells to interrupt Non-secure code running on the
other core. Attempting to access this address range from Non-secure code will generate a bus fault.

 (^) NOTE
The 0x20000 offset of the Secure-to-Non-secure mirror matches the PPB mirrors at 0xe0000000 (PPB_BASE) and
0xe0020000 (PPB_NONSEC_BASE), which function similarly.
 (^) NOTE
Debug access is mapped to the Secure/Non-secure SIO using the security attribute of the debugger’s bus access,
which may differ from the security state that the core was halted in.

#### 3.1.2. CPUID

```
The CPUID SIO register returns a value of 0 when read by core 0, and 1 when read by core 1. This helps software identify
the core running the current application. The initial boot sequence also relies on this check: both cores start running
simultaneously, core 1 goes into a deep sleep state, and core 0 continues the main boot sequence.
```
######  IMPORTANT

Don’t confuse the SIO CPUID register with the Cortex-M33 CPUID register on each processor’s internal Private
Peripheral Bus, which lists the processor’s part number and version.
3.1. SIO 38

######  NOTE

Reading the MHARTID CSR on each Hazard3 core returns the same values as CPUID: 0 on core 0, and 1 on core 1.

#### 3.1.3. GPIO control

```
The SIO GPIO registers control GPIOs which have the SIO function selected (function 5 ). This function is supported on
the following pins:
```
- All user GPIOs (GPIOs 0 through 29, or 0 through 47, depending on package option)
- QSPI pins
- USB DP/DM pins
All SIO GPIO control registers come in pairs. The lower-addressed register in each pair (for example, GPIO_IN) is
connected to GPIOs 0 through 31, and the higher-addressed register in each pair (for example, GPIO_HI_IN) is
connected to GPIOs 32 through 47, the QSPI pins, and the USB DP/DM pins.

######  NOTE

```
To drive a pin with the SIO’s GPIO registers, the GPIO multiplexer for this pin must first be configured to select the
SIO GPIO function. See Table 646.
These GPIO registers are shared between the two cores: both cores can access them simultaneously. There are three
groups of registers:
```
- Output registers, GPIO_OUT and GPIO_HI_OUT set the output level of the GPIO. 0 for low output, 1 for high output.
- Output enable registers, GPIO_OE and GPIO_HI_OE, are used to enable the output driver. 0 for high-impedance, 1
    for drive high or low based on GPIO_OUT and GPIO_HI_OUT.
- Input registers, GPIO_IN and GPIO_HI_IN, allow the processor to sample the current state of the GPIOs.
Reading GPIO_IN returns up to 32 input values in a single read, and software then masks out individual pins it is
interested in.
SDK: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_gpio/include/hardware/gpio.h Lines 869 - 879
869 static inline bool gpio_get(uint gpio) {
870 #ifdef NUM_BANK0_GPIOS <= 32
871 return sio_hw->gpio_in & (1u << gpio);
872 #else
873 if (gpio < 32) {
874 return sio_hw->gpio_in & (1u << gpio);
875 } else {
876 return sio_hw->gpio_hi_in & (1u << (gpio - 32));
877 }
878 #endif
879 }
The OUT and OE registers also have atomic SET, CLR, and XOR aliases. This allows software to update a subset of the pins in
one operation. This ensures safety for concurrent GPIO access, both between the two cores and between a single core’s
interrupt handler and foreground code.

1180 }
If both processors write to an OUT or OE register (or any of its SET/CLR/XOR aliases) on the same clock cycle, the result is as
though core 0 wrote first, then core 1 wrote immediately afterward. For example, if core 0 SETs a bit and core 1 XORs it
on the same clock cycle, the bit ends up with a value of 0.
3.1. SIO 40

######  NOTE

```
This is a conceptual model for the result produced when two cores write to a GPIO register simultaneously. The
register never contains the intermediate values at any point. In the previous example, if the pin is initially 0 , and core
0 performs a SET while core 1 performs a XOR, the GPIO output remains low throughout the clock cycle.
As well as being shared between cores, the GPIO registers are also shared between security domains. The Secure and
Non-secure SIO offer alternative views of the same GPIO registers, which are always mapped as GPIO function 5.
However, the Non-secure SIO can only access pins which are enabled in the GPIO Non-secure mask configured by the
ACCESSCTRL registers GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1. The layout of the NSMASK registers matches the layout
of the SIO registers — for example, QSPI_SCK is bit 26 in both GPIO_HI_IN and GPIO_NSMASK1.
When a pin is not enabled in Non-secure code:
```
- Writes to the corresponding GPIO registers from a Non-secure context have no effect.
- Reads from a Non-secure context return zeroes.
- Reads and writes from a Secure context function as usual using the Secure bank.
The GPIO coprocessor port (Section 3.6.1) provides dedicated instructions for accessing the SIO GPIO registers from
the Cortex-M33 processors. This includes the ability to read and write 64 bits in a single operation.

#### 3.1.4. Hardware spinlocks

```
The SIO provides 32 hardware spinlocks, which can be used to manage mutually-exclusive access to shared software
resources. Each spinlock is a one-bit flag, mapped to a different address (from SPINLOCK0 to SPINLOCK31). Software
interacts with each spinlock with one of the following operations:
```
- Read: Attempt to claim the lock. Read value is non-zero if the lock was successfully claimed, or zero if the lock had
    already been claimed by a previous read.
- Write (any value): Release the lock. The next attempt to claim the lock will succeed.
If both cores try to claim the same lock on the same clock cycle, core 0 succeeds.
Generally software will acquire a lock by repeatedly polling the lock bit ("spinning" on the lock) until it is successfully
claimed. This is inefficient if the lock is held for long periods, so generally the spinlocks should be used to protect short
critical sections of higher-level primitives such as mutexes, semaphores and queues.
For debugging purposes, the current state of all 32 spinlocks can be observed via SPINLOCK_ST.

 (^) NOTE
RP2350 has separate spinlocks for Secure and Non-secure SIO banks because sharing these registers would allow
Non-secure code to deliberately starve Secure code that attempts to acquire a lock. See Section 3.1.1.

######  NOTE

The processors on RP2350 support standard atomic/exclusive access instructions which, in concert with the global
exclusive monitor (Section 2.1.6), allow both cores to safely share variables in SRAM. The SIO spinlocks are still
included for compatibility with RP2040.
3.1. SIO 41

######  NOTE

```
Due to RP2350-E2, writes to new SIO registers above an offset of +0x180 alias the spinlocks, causing spurious lock
releases. The SDK by default uses atomic memory accesses to implement the hardware_sync_spin_lock API, as a
workaround on RP2350 A2.
```
#### 3.1.5. Inter-processor FIFOs (Mailboxes)

```
The SIO contains two FIFOs for passing data, messages or ordered events between the two cores. Each FIFO is 32 bits
wide and four entries deep. One of the FIFOs can only be written by core 0 and read by core 1. The other can only be
written by core 1 and read by core 0.
Each core writes to its outgoing FIFO by writing to FIFO_WR and reads from its incoming FIFO by reading from FIFO_RD.
A status register, FIFO_ST, provides the following status signals:
```
- Incoming FIFO contains data (VLD).
- Outgoing FIFO has room for more data (RDY).
- The incoming FIFO was read from while empty at some point in the past (ROE).
- The outgoing FIFO was written to while full at some point in the past (WOF).
Writing to the outgoing FIFO while full, or reading from the incoming FIFO while empty, does not affect the FIFO state.
The current contents and level of the FIFO is preserved. However, this does represent some loss of data or reception of
invalid data by the software accessing the FIFO, so a sticky error flag is raised (ROE or WOF).
The SIO has a FIFO IRQ output for each core to notify the core that it has received FIFO data. This is a core-local
interrupt, mapped to the same IRQ number on each core (SIO_IRQ_FIFO, interrupt number 25 ). Non-secure FIFO interrupts
use a separate interrupt line, (SIO_IRQ_FIFO_NS, interrupt number 27 ). It is not possible to interrupt on the opposite core’s
FIFO.
Each IRQ output is the logical OR of the VLD, ROE and WOF bits in that core’s FIFO_ST register: that is, the IRQ is asserted if
any of these three bits is high, and clears again when they are all low. To clear the ROE and WOF flags, write any value to
FIFO_ST. To clear the VLD flag, read data from the FIFO until it is empty.
If the corresponding interrupt line is enabled in the processor’s interrupt controller, the processor takes an interrupt
each time data appears in its FIFO, or if it has performed some invalid FIFO operation (read on empty, write on full).

######  NOTE

```
ROE and WOF only become set if software misbehaves in some way. Generally, the interrupt handler triggers when data
appears in the FIFO, raising the VLD flag. Then, the interrupt handler clears the IRQ by reading data from the FIFO until
VLD goes low once more.
The inter-processor FIFOs and the Event signals are used by the bootrom (Chapter 5) wait_for_vector routine, where core
1 remains in a sleep state until it is woken, and provided with its initial stack pointer, entry point and vector table through
the FIFO.
```
 (^) NOTE
RP2350 has separate FIFOs and interrupts for Secure and Non-secure SIO banks. See Section 3.1.

#### 3.1.6. Doorbells

The doorbell registers raise an interrupt on the opposite core. There are 8 doorbell flags in each direction, combined into
a single doorbell interrupt per core. This is a core-local interrupt: the same interrupt number on each core (SIO_IRQ_BELL,
interrupt number 26 ) notifies that core of incoming doorbell interrupts.
3.1. SIO 42

```
Whereas the mailbox FIFOs are used for cross-core events whose count and order is important, doorbells are used for
events which are accumulative (i.e. may post multiple times, but only answered once) and which can be responded to in
any order.
Writing a non-zero value to the DOORBELL_OUT_SET register raises the opposite core’s doorbell interrupt. The interrupt
remains raised until all bits are cleared. Generally, the opposite core enters its doorbell interrupt handler, reads its
DOORBELL_IN_CLR register to get the mask of active doorbell flags, and then writes back to acknowledge and clear the
interrupt.
The DOORBELL_IN_SET register allows a processor to ring its own doorbell. This is useful when the routine which rings
a doorbell can be scheduled on either core. Likewise, for symmetry, a processor can clear the opposite core’s doorbell
flags using the DOORBELL_OUT_CLR register: this is useful for setup code, but should be avoided in general because of
the potential for race conditions when acknowledging interrupts meant for the opposite core.
At any time, a core can read back its DOORBELL_OUT_SET or DOORBELL_OUT_CLR register (they return the same
result) to see the status of doorbell interrupts posted to the opposite core. Likewise, reading either DOORBELL_IN_SET
or DOORBELL_IN_CLR returns the status of doorbell interrupts posted to this core.
```
 (^) NOTE
RP2350 has separate per-core doorbell interrupt signals and doorbell registers for Secure and Non-secure SIO
banks. Non-secure doorbells are posted on SIO_IRQ_BELL_NS, interrupt number 28. See Section 3.1.1.

#### 3.1.7. Integer divider

```
RP2040’s memory-mapped integer divider peripheral is not present on RP2350, since the processors support divide
instructions. The address space previously allocated for the divider registers is now reserved.
```
#### 3.1.8. RISC-V platform timer

```
This 64-bit timer is a standard peripheral described in the RISC-V privileged specification, usable equally by the Arm and
RISC-V processors on RP2350. It drives the per-core SIO_IRQ_MTIMECMP system-level interrupt (Section 3.2), as well as the
mip.mtip timer interrupt on the RISC-V processors.
There is a single 64-bit counter, shared between both cores. The low and high half can be accessed through the MTIME
and MTIMEH SIO registers. Use the following procedure to safely read the 64-bit time using 32-bit register accesses:
```
1. Read the upper half, MTIMEH.
2. Read the lower half, MTIME.
3. Read the upper half again.
4. Loop if the two upper-half reads returned different values.
This is similar to the procedure for reading RP2350 system timers (Section 12.8). The loop should only happen once,
when the timer is read at exactly the instant of a 32-bit rollover, and even this is only occasional. If you require constant-
time operation, you can instead zero the lower half when the two upper-half reads differ.
Timer interrupts are generated based on a per-core 64-bit time comparison value, accessed through the MTIMECMP
and MTIMECMPH SIO registers. Each core gets its own copy of these registers, accessed at the same address. The per-
core interrupt is asserted whenever the current time indicated in the MTIME registers is greater than or equal to that
core’s MTIMECMP. Use the following sequence to write a new 64-bit timer comparison value without causing spurious
interrupts:
1. Write all-ones to MTIMECMP (guaranteed greater than or equal to the old value, and the lower half of the target
value).
2. Write the upper half of the target value to MTIMECMPH (combined 64-bit value is still greater than or equal to the
target value).
3.1. SIO 43

3. Write the lower half of the target value to MTIMECMP.
The RISC-V timer can count either ticks from the system-level tick generator (Section 8.5), or system clock cycles,
selected by the MTIME_CTRL register. Use a 1 microsecond time base for compatibility with most RISC-V software.

#### 3.1.9. TMDS encoder

```
Each core is equipped with an implementation of the TMDS encode algorithm described in chapter 3 of the DVI 1.
specification. In general, the HSTX peripheral (Section 12.11) supports lower processor overhead for DVI-D output as
well as a wider range of pixel formats, but the SIO TMDS encoders are included for use with non-HSTX-capable GPIOs.
The TMDS_CTRL register allows configuration of a number of input pixel formats, from 16-bit RGB down to 1-bit
monochrome. Once the encoder has been set up, the processor writes 32 bits of colour data at a time to TMDS_WDATA,
and then reads TMDS data symbols from the output registers. Depending on the pixel format, there may be multiple
TMDS symbols read for each write to TMDS_WDATA. There are no stalls: encoding is limited entirely by the processor’s
load/store bandwidth, up to one 32-bit read or write per cycle per core.
To allow for framebuffer/scanbuffer resolution lower than the display resolution, the output registers have both peek
and pop aliases (e.g. TMDS_PEEK_SINGLE and TMDS_POP_SINGLE). Reading either register advances the encoder’s DC
balance counter, but only the pop alias shifts the colour data in TMDS_WDATA so that multiple correctly-DC-balanced
TMDS symbols can be generated from the same input pixel.
The TMDS encoder peripherals are not duplicated over security domains. They are assigned to the Secure SIO at reset,
and can be reassigned to the Non-secure SIO using the PERI_NONSEC register.
```
#### 3.1.10. Interpolator

```
Each core is equipped with two interpolators (INTERP0 and INTERP1) that can accelerate tasks by combining certain pre-
configured operations into a single processor cycle. Intended for cases where the pre-configured operation repeats
many times, interpolators result in code which uses both fewer CPU cycles and fewer CPU registers in time-critical
sections.
The interpolators already accelerate audio operations within the SDK. Their flexible configuration makes it possible to
optimise many other tasks, including:
```
- quantization
- dithering
- table lookup address generation
- affine texture mapping
- decompression
- linear feedback

CROSS_INPUT, SIGNED,
and ADD_RAW.
The processor can write or read any interpolator register in one cycle, and the results are ready on the next cycle. The
processor can also perform an addition on one of the two accumulators ACCUM0 or ACCUM1 by writing to the corresponding
ACCUMx_ADD register.
The three results are available in the read-only locations PEEK0, PEEK1, PEEK2. Reading from these locations does not
change the state of the interpolator. The results are also aliased at the locations POP0, POP1, POP2; reading from a POPx alias
returns the same result as the corresponding PEEKx, and simultaneously writes back the lane results to the
accumulators. Use the POPx aliases to advance the state of interpolator each time a result is read.
You can adjust interpolator behaviour with the following operational modes:

- fractional blending between two values
- clamping^ values to restrict them within a given range.
The following example shows a trivial example of popping a lane result to produce simple iterative feedback.

Figure 9. Each lane of
each interpolator can
be configured to
perform mask, shift
and sign-extension on
one of the
accumulators. This is
fed into adders which
produce final results,
which may optionally
be fed back into the
accumulators with
each read. The
datapath can be
configured using a
handful of 32-bit
multiplexers. From left
to right, these are
controlled by the
following CTRL flags:
CROSS_RESULT,
CROSS_INPUT, SIGNED,
and ADD_RAW.
Each lane performs these three operations, in sequence:

- A right shift by^ CTRL_LANEx_SHIFT^ (0 to 31 bits)
- A mask of bits from^ CTRL_LANEx_MASK_LSB^ to^ CTRL_LANEx_MASK_MSB^ inclusive (each ranging from bit 0 to bit 31)
- A sign extension from the top of the mask, i.e. take bit^ CTRL_LANEx_MASK_MSB^ and OR it into all more-significant bits, if
    CTRL_LANEx_SIGNED is set
For example, if:
- ACCUM0^ =^ 0xdeadbeef
- CTRL_LANE0_SHIFT^ = 8
- CTRL_LANE0_MASK_LSB^ = 4
- CTRL_LANE0_MASK_MSB^ = 7
- CTRL_SIGNED^ = 1
Then lane 0 would produce the following results at each stage:
- Right shift by 8 to produce^ 0x00deadbe
- Mask bits 7 to 4 to produce^ 0x00deadbe & 0x000000f0^ =^ 0x000000b
- Sign-extend up from bit 7 to produce^ 0xffffffb

###### 3.1.10.2. Blend mode

```
Blend mode is available on INTERP0 on each core, and is enabled by the CTRL_LANE0_BLEND control flag. It performs linear
interpolation, which we define as follows:
Where is the register BASE0, is the register BASE1, and is a fractional value formed from the least significant 8 bits
of the lane 1 shift and mask value.
Blend mode differs from normal mode in the following ways:
```
- PEEK0,^ POP0^ return the 8-bit alpha value (the 8 LSBs of the lane 1 shift and mask value), with zeroes in result bits 31
    down to 24.
- PEEK1,^ POP1^ return the linear interpolation between^ BASE0^ and^ BASE
- PEEK2,^ POP2^ do not include lane 1 result in the addition (i.e. it is^ BASE2^ + lane 0 shift and mask value)
The result of the linear interpolation is equal to BASE0 when the alpha value is 0, and equal to BASE0 + 255/256 * (BASE1 -
BASE0) when the alpha value is all-ones.

CTRL_LANE1_SIGNED controls whether BASE0 and BASE1 are sign-extended for this interpolation (this sign extension is required
because the interpolation produces an intermediate product value 40 bits in size). CTRL_LANE0_SIGNED continues to control
the sign extension of the lane 0 intermediate result in PEEK2, POP2 as normal.

Finally, in blend mode when using the BASE_1AND0 register to send a 16-bit value to each of BASE0 and BASE1 with a single
32-bit write, the sign-extension of these 16-bit values to full 32-bit values during the write is controlled by
CTRL_LANE1_SIGNED for both bases, as opposed to non-blend-mode operation, where CTRL_LANE0_SIGNED affects extension
into BASE0 and CTRL_LANE1_SIGNED affects extension into BASE1.

###### 3.1.10.3. Clamp Mode

Clamp mode is available on INTERP1 on each core. To enable clamp mode, set the CTRL_LANE0_CLAMP control flag to high. In
clamp mode, the PEEK0/POP0 result is the lane value (shifted, masked, sign-extended ACCUM0) clamped between BASE0 and
BASE1. In other words, if the lane value is less than BASE0, a value of BASE0 is produced; if greater than BASE1, a value of BASE
is produced; otherwise, the value passes through. No addition is performed. The signedness of these comparisons is
controlled by the CTRL_LANE0_SIGNED flag.
Other than this, the interpolator behaves the same as in normal mode.

###### 3.1.10.4. Sample use case: linear interpolation

Linear interpolation combines blend mode with other interpolator functionality. In this example, ACCUM0 tracks a fixed-
point (integer/fraction) position within a list of values to be interpolated. Lane 0 is used to produce an address into the
value array for the integer part of the position. The fractional part of the position is shifted to produce a value from 0-
255 for the blend. The blend is performed between two consecutive values in the array.
Finally the fractional position is updated via a single write to ACCUM0_ADD_RAW.

###### 3.1.10.5. Sample use case: simple affine texture mapping

Simple affine texture mapping can be implemented by using fixed-point arithmetic for texture coordinates, and stepping
a fixed amount in each coordinate for every pixel in a scanline. The integer parts of the texture coordinates form an
address into the texture. Reading from POP2 adds the offset to the texture base pointer. The processor loads the
resulting address to sample a pixel colour from the texture.
By using two lanes, all three base values, and the CTRL_LANEx_ADD_RAW flag, you can use the interpolator to reduce an
expensive CPU operation to a single cycle iteration.

that intermediate result.
In the Non-secure SIO, Secure-only GPIOs (as per ACCESSCTRL)
ignore writes, and their output status reads back as zero. This is
also true for SET/CLR/XOR aliases of this register.

0x180 DOORBELL_OUT_SET Trigger a doorbell interrupt on the opposite core.
Write 1 to a bit to set the corresponding bit in DOORBELL_IN on
the opposite core. This raises the opposite core’s doorbell
interrupt.
Read to get the status of the doorbells currently asserted on the
opposite core. This is equivalent to that core reading its own
DOORBELL_IN status.
3.1. SIO 57

Offset Name Info
0x184 DOORBELL_OUT_CLR Clear doorbells which have been posted to the opposite core.
This register is intended for debugging and initialisation
purposes.
Writing 1 to a bit in DOORBELL_OUT_CLR clears the
corresponding bit in DOORBELL_IN on the opposite core.
Clearing all bits will cause that core’s doorbell interrupt to
deassert. Since the usual order of events is for software to send
events using DOORBELL_OUT_SET, and acknowledge incoming
events by writing to DOORBELL_IN_CLR, this register should be
used with caution to avoid race conditions.
Reading returns the status of the doorbells currently asserted on
the other core, i.e. is equivalent to that core reading its own
DOORBELL_IN status.
0x188 DOORBELL_IN_SET Write 1s to trigger doorbell interrupts on this core. Read to get
status of doorbells currently asserted on this core.
0x18c DOORBELL_IN_CLR Check and acknowledge doorbells posted to this core. This
core’s doorbell interrupt is asserted when any bit in this register
is 1.
Write 1 to each bit to clear that bit. The doorbell interrupt
deasserts once all bits are cleared. Read to get status of
doorbells currently asserted on this core.
0x190 PERI_NONSEC Detach certain core-local peripherals from Secure SIO, and
attach them to Non-secure SIO, so that Non-secure software can
use them. Attempting to access one of these peripherals from
the Secure SIO when it is attached to the Non-secure SIO, or vice
versa, will generate a bus error.
This register is per-core, and is only present on the Secure SIO.
Most SIO hardware is duplicated across the Secure and Non-
secure SIO, so is not listed in this register.
0x1a0 RISCV_SOFTIRQ Control the assertion of the standard software interrupt
(MIP.MSIP) on the RISC-V cores.
Unlike the RISC-V timer, this interrupt is not routed to a normal
system-level interrupt line, so can not be used by the Arm cores.
It is safe for both cores to write to this register on the same
cycle. The set/clear effect is accumulated across both cores,
and then applied. If a flag is both set and cleared on the same
cycle, only the set takes effect.
3.1. SIO 58

Offset Name Info
0x1a4 MTIME_CTRL Control register for the RISC-V 64-bit Machine-mode timer. This
timer is only present in the Secure SIO, so is only accessible to
an Arm core in Secure mode or a RISC-V core in Machine mode.
Note whilst this timer follows the RISC-V privileged specification,
it is equally usable by the Arm cores. The interrupts are routed to
normal system-level interrupt lines as well as to the MIP.MTIP
inputs on the RISC-V cores.
0x1b0 MTIME Read/write access to the high half of RISC-V Machine-mode
timer. This register is shared between both cores. If both cores
write on the same cycle, core 1 takes precedence.
0x1b4 MTIMEH Read/write access to the high half of RISC-V Machine-mode
timer. This register is shared between both cores. If both cores
write on the same cycle, core 1 takes precedence.
0x1b8 MTIMECMP Low half of RISC-V Machine-mode timer comparator. This
register is core-local, i.e., each core gets a copy of this register,
with the comparison result routed to its own interrupt line.
The timer interrupt is asserted whenever MTIME is greater than
or equal to MTIMECMP. This comparison is unsigned, and
performed on the full 64-bit values.
0x1bc MTIMECMPH High half of RISC-V Machine-mode timer comparator. This
register is core-local.
The timer interrupt is asserted whenever MTIME is greater than
or equal to MTIMECMP. This comparison is unsigned, and
performed on the full 64-bit values.

0x1c8 TMDS_PEEK_SINGLE Get the encoding of one pixel’s worth of colour data, packed into
a 32-bit value (3x10-bit symbols).
The PEEK alias does not shift the colour register when read, but
still advances the running DC balance state of each encoder.
This is useful for pixel doubling.
0x1cc TMDS_POP_SINGLE Get the encoding of one pixel’s worth of colour data, packed into
a 32-bit value. The packing is 5 chunks of 3 lanes times 2 bits (30
bits total). Each chunk contains two bits of a TMDS symbol per
lane. This format is intended for shifting out with the HSTX
peripheral on RP2350.
The POP alias shifts the colour register when read, as well as
advancing the running DC balance state of each encoder.

processing the entire scanline for one lane before moving to the
next lane.
0x1d4 TMDS_POP_DOUBLE_L0 Get lane 0 of the encoding of two pixels' worth of colour data.

## 3.2. Interrupts

```
Each core is equipped with an internal interrupt controller, with 52 interrupt inputs. For the most part each core has
exactly the same interrupts routed to it, though there are some exceptions, referred to as core-local interrupts, where
there is an individual per-core interrupt source mapped to the same interrupt number on each core:
```
- Cross-core FIFO interrupts:^ SIO_IRQ_FIFO^ and^ SIO_IRQ_FIFO_NS^ (Section 3.1.5)
- Cross-core doorbell interrupts:^ SIO_IRQ_BELL^ and^ SIO_IRQ_BELL_NS^ (Section 3.1.6)
- RISC-V platform timer (also usable by Arm cores):^ SIO_IRQ_MTIMECMP^ (Section 3.1.8)
- GPIO interrupts:^ IO_IRQ_BANK0,^ IRQ_IO_BANK0_NS,^ IO_IRQ_QSPI,^ IO_IRQ_QSPI_NS^ (Section 9.5)
The remaining interrupt inputs have the same interrupt source mirrored identically on both cores. Non-core-local
interrupts should only be enabled in the interrupt controller of a single core at a time, and will be serviced by the core
whose interrupt controller they are enabled in.
Table 95. System-level
interrupt numbering.
All interrupts are
routed to both
processors.

10 DMA_IRQ_0 21 IO_IRQ_BANK0 32 SPI1_IRQ 43 PLL_USB_IRQ
On RP2350, only the lower 46 IRQ signals are connected to system-level interrupt sources, and IRQs 46 to 51 are
hardwired to zero (never firing). These six spare interrupts, referred to as SPAREIRQ_IRQ_0 through SPAREIRQ_IRQ_5 in the
table, are deliberately reserved for the cores to interrupt themselves (via the Arm NVIC_ISPR0 registers or the Hazard3
MEIFA CSR), for example, when an interrupt handler wants to schedule a "bottom half" handler for work that must be
done after exiting the interrupt handler, but before returning to the code running in the foreground.
Nested interrupts are supported in hardware: a lower-priority interrupt can be pre-empted by a higher-priority interrupt or
fault, and will resume once the higher-priority handler returns. The pre-emption priority order is determined by the
interrupt priority registers starting from NVIC_IPR0 (Cortex-M33) or the MEIPRA interrupt priority array CSR (Hazard3).
When there is a choice of multiple interrupts to be entered at the same dynamic priority, the interrupt with the lowest
IRQ number is chosen as a tie-breaker. The system-level IRQ numbering has been chosen to generally put higher-priority
interrupts at lower IRQ numbers for this reason, though the true priority is often dependent on the specific application.
```
#### 3.2.1. Non-maskable interrupt (NMI)

```
The system IRQ signals can be routed to the Cortex-M33 non-maskable interrupt (NMI) input, by setting the bit for that
IRQ number in NMI_MASK0 or NMI_MASK1. The non-maskable interrupt ignores the processor’s interrupt
enable/disable state (PRIMASK), and can pre-empt any other active interrupt. NMIs are generally used for emergent
circumstances that require the processor’s unconditional attention, such as loss of PLL lock or power supply integrity.
The NMI mask registers are core-local, so each core can have a different combination of interrupts routed to its NMI
input. The NMI mask, along with all other EPPB registers, is reset by a warm reset of that core. This avoids an issue on
RP2040 where the NMI mask could be left set following a processor reset.
In addition to system-level interrupts, the non-maskable interrupt is asserted when an integrity check is failed in the
redundancy coprocessor (RCP, Section 3.6.3). This behaviour cannot be disabled, but a correctly-programmed RCP
does not trigger under normal voltage, frequency, and temperature conditions. Likewise, if user code does not execute
any RCP instructions, the RCP will never trigger. The RCP NMI output is asserted on both cores when an integrity check
fails, and is de-asserted by a warm processor reset.
```
#### 3.2.2. Further reading on interrupts

```
This section describes the routing of system-level interrupt requests to the processor subsystem. It omits important
details such as the processor’s response to receiving an interrupt, and how processors choose which system-level
interrupt requests to subscribe to. The following is a selection of relevant information for these topics:
```
- Section 3.7.2.5 describes the Cortex-M33’s internal interrupt controller, the NVIC
- Register listings starting from NVIC_ISER0 describe controls for NVIC operation
- Section 3.7.4.6 is an overview of Cortex-M33 exception handling
3.2. Interrupts 83

- The Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual describes detailed architecture rules for exception handling
- Section 3.8.4 describes standard RISC-V trap handling
- Section 3.8.4.2 describes the standard RISC-V external, timer and software interrupt requests, and how they are
    connected on RP2350
- Section 3.8.6.1 describes the Xh3irq interrupt controller, which provides priority-controlled interrupt support for the
    system-level interrupts on Hazard3
- Each peripheral has its own interrupt registers which control the assertion of its system-level interrupts listed in
    Table 95 — see peripheral documentation for more information

## 3.3. Event signals (Arm)

```
Using the WFE instruction, the Cortex-M33 can enter a sleep state until an "event" (or interrupt) takes place. It can also
generate events using the SEV instruction. RP2350 cross-wires event signals between the two processors: an event sent
by one processor will be received on the other.
```
######  NOTE

```
The event flag is "sticky": if both processors send an event (SEV) simultaneously, then enter the sleep state (WFE), they
will both wake immediately. This prevents the processors from getting stuck in a sleep state in this scenario.
Processors also receive an event signal from the global monitor if their reservation is lost due to a write by a different
master, in accordance with Armv8-M architecture requirements.
While in a WFE (or WFI) sleep state, the processor shuts off its internal clock gates to reduce power consumption. When
both processors are in a sleep state and the DMA is inactive, all of RP2350 can enter a sleep state, disabling clocks on
unused infrastructure such as the bus fabric. The rest of RP2350 wakes automatically when either of the processors
wakes. See Section 6.5.2.
```
## 3.4. Event signals (RISC-V)

```
The Hazard3 h3.block instruction halts processor execution until an unblock signal is received. The h3.unblock instruction
sends an unblock signal to other processors. These NOP-compatible hint instructions are documented in Section
3.8.6.3.
On RP2350 the Hazard3 unblock in/out signals are cross-connected between the two processors, and each processor’s
unblock output is also fed back into its input. The global monitor also posts an unblock signal to each core when that
core loses a reservation due to an access by another core or the system DMA.
The Hazard3 MSLEEP CSR defines how deep a sleep the processor will enter when executing a h3.block instruction. By
default this is a simple pipeline stall, but the processor can also gate its own clock and negotiate the system-level clock
wake/sleep state with the clocks block (Section 6.5.2).
The h3.unblock instruction is "sticky": an h3.block will fall through immediately if any unblock signal has been received
since the last time the processor executed an h3.block instruction.
```
## 3.5. Debug

The Serial Wire Debug (SWD) bus provides access to hardware and software debug features including:

- Loading firmware into SRAM or external flash memory
3.3. Event signals (Arm) 84

- Control of processor execution: run/halt, step, set breakpoints, other standard debug functionality
- Access to processor architectural state
- Access to memory and memory-mapped IO via the system bus
- Configuring the CoreSight trace hardware (Arm processors only)
The SWD bus is exposed on two dedicated pins, SWCLK and SWDIO. See Table 1430 for the pin definitions for SWCLK
and SWDIO, and see Table 1440 for additional information on their specifications.
A single SW-DP provides access to RP2350’s debug subsystem from the external SWCLK and SWDIO pins. The DP is
multidrop-capable, but use of multidrop SWD is not mandatory. All hardware in the debug subsystem, with the exception
of the RP-AP, can also be accessed directly from the system bus using the self-hosted debug window starting at
CORESIGHT_PERIPH_BASE.

RP-AP are also accessible through self-hosted debug.
The SW-DP and RP-AP are in the always-on power domain, and are available once external power is applied and the
power-on reset (POR) time has elapsed. All other APs in Figure 10 are available only once:
1. the power manager (POWMAN) has sequenced the first power up of the switched core domain
2. the OTP PSM has read critical hardware configuration flags from OTP
3. the system clock (clk_sys) is running

#### 3.5.1. Connecting to the SW-DP

```
The SW-DP defaults to the Dormant state at power-up or assertion of the external reset (RUN) pin. A Dormant-to-SWD
sequence must be issued before beginning SWD operations. See the Arm Debug Interface specification, version 6, for
details of Dormant/SWD state switching: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0074/latest/
After a power-on, the following sequence can be used to connect to the SW-DP:
```
1. At least 8 × SWCLK cycles with SWDIO high.
3.5. Debug 85

2. The 128-bit Selection Alert sequence: 0x19bc0ea2, 0xe3ddafe9, 0x86852d95, 0x6209f392, LSB-first.
3. Four SWCLK cycles with SWDIO low.
4. SWD activation code sequence : 0x1a, LSB first.
5. At least 50 × SWCLK cycles with SWDIO high (line reset).
6. A DPIDR read to exit the Reset state
In order to wake up the system from a low power (P1.x) state, set the CDBGPWRUPREQ in the DP CTRL/STAT register,
then poll CDBGPWRUPACK in the same register until set. In low-power states, only the SW-DP and RP-AP are accessible,
as the remaining debug logic is unpowered.

#### 3.5.2. Arm debug

```
There are two AHB5 Mem-APs, at offsets 0x02000 and 0x04000 in the debug address space, which are used to debug the
two Arm Cortex-M33 processors. Each Mem-AP is an AHB5 manager which accesses a 32-bit downstream address
space. This is the same address space accessed by a processor’s load/store instructions, which includes system-level
hardware such as memory and peripherals, and processor-internal hardware on the processor’s private peripheral bus
(PPB). Certain PPB registers are visible only when accessed from the Mem-AP, not when accessed by software running
on the processor.
The AHB5 Mem-AP’s own register map is defined in Arm’s ADIv6 specification. Generally this is only of interest to those
implementing their own debug translator, and the Mem-AP can be thought of simply as a bridge between a DP (such as
RP2350’s SW-DP) and a downstream address space.
The standard Arm debug registers used to debug software running on the Cortex-M33 can be found documented in the
Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual, or the Cortex-M33 Technical Reference Manual, available from Arm Ltd. This
datasheet also documents the core’s internal registers in Section 3.7.5.
The Mem-APs can access system peripherals and memory at exactly the same addresses they would be accessed by
software running on the processor. However, the privilege and security of Mem-AP accesses may be different from the
security state of the software running on the processor at the point it halted: the privilege and security of Mem-AP
accesses is configured explicitly via its control and status word (CSW) register. Care must be taken when debugging
Non-secure software which accesses the SIO, for example, because by default the debugger may access the Secure
alias of the SIO, not the Non-secure alias which software will have been accessing.
The bus filters configured by the ACCESSCTRL bus access permission registers (Section 10.6.2) treat bus accesses
originating from the Mem-APs as distinct from bus accesses originating from software running on the processor. This
means it is possible to lock software out from a peripheral, whilst still allowing debugger access.
```
#### 3.5.3. RISC-V debug

There is a single APB Mem-AP, at offset 0x0a000 in the debug address space, which provides access only to the RISC-V
Debug Module (DM). The DM is a standard component which the debugger uses to enumerate RISC-V harts present in
the system, debug software running on each hart, and access the system bus. It is defined in the RISC-V debug
specification, of which RP2350 implements version 0.13.2.
From the point of view of the RISC-V debug specification, the SW-DP and APB Mem-AP function jointly as the Debug
Transport Module for this system. The DM is located at offset 0x0 in the APB-AP’s downstream address space, and the
registers are word-sized and byte-addressed, meaning the DM register addresses in the debug specification must be
multiplied by 4 to get the correct APB address.
On RP2350, each core possesses exactly one hardware thread (hart). Core 0 has a hart ID of 0, and core 1 has a hart ID
of 1. These hart IDs match the hart index used in the DM. This DM is also equipped with the hart array mask select
extension, which allows multiple cores to be reset/halted/resumed simultaneously.
The DM is equipped with the System Bus Access (SBA) extension, which allows the debugger to access the system bus
without halting either core. This can be used for minimally intrusive debug techniques like Segger RTT. SBA accesses
3.5. Debug 86

```
arbitrate with core 1’s load/store port to access the system bus, but they are treated as distinct from core 1’s accesses
for the purpose of bus filtering (Section 10.6.2), which means it is possible to lock software out of a peripheral whilst
retaining debug access. Processor load/stores in Debug mode are also treated as debug accesses for the purpose of
bus filtering.
The DM is able to reset each core individually using the dmcontrol.hartreset control. This resets only the selected
processor. The dmcontrol.ndmreset resets both processors only, which is the minimum requirement in the RISC-V debug
specification. A full system reset, which includes the DM, can be performed using the SYSRESETREQ control in the SW-
DP, a switched core domain reset configured in POWMAN and initiated by the watchdog, or any full-system reset such
as the RUN pin. A PSM reset initiated by the watchdog can reset almost all system-level hardware except for the DM,
but note that the DM becomes momentarily inaccessible whilst the system clock’s clock generator is reset, which is the
reason for dmcontrol.ndmreset resetting the processors only.
For details on the processor side of RISC-V debug, see Section 3.8.5. See also the Hazard3 source code at
github.com/Wren6991/Hazard3, which includes the DM implementation under the hdl/debug/dm/ directory.
```
#### 3.5.4. Debug power domains

```
The SW-DP and the RP-AP are in the always-on power domain. This means they are available even when the system is in
its lowest-power state, with the switched core domain (which includes the processors) fully powered down.
The remainder of the debug hardware is in the switched core domain. This is the same domain as the processors and
system peripherals.
Setting the CDBGPWRUPREQ bit in the SW-DP’s CTRL/STAT register will force a power up of the switched core domain,
making the remaining debug hardware available. This power up takes some time, as it is sequenced by the 32 kHz low-
power oscillator (Section 8.4), so the CDBGPWRUPACK bit must be polled to wait for the system to power up before
attempting to access any APs other than the RP-AP. See Arm’s ADIv6 specification for the SW-DP’s register listing.
Note that the RP-AP is accessible without asserting CDBGPWRUPREQ, as it is always powered.
```
#### 3.5.5. Software control of SWD pins

```
The DBGFORCE register in SYSCFG can be used to detach the SW-DP from the external debug pads, and instead bitbang
the internal SWD signals directly from software. This is intended for a debug probe running on one core being used to
debug the other core. For other use cases it is generally cleaner to use the self-hosted debug access to interface with
the APs directly from the system bus.
```
#### 3.5.6. Self-hosted debug

All APs shown in Figure 10, except for the RP-AP, have direct memory-mapped access from the system bus. This is
known as self-hosted debug, because with care it allows running a debug host (i.e. a debugger) directly on-system. It
can also be used to access the trace hardware, which can be used for self-hosted trace using the trace DMA FIFO. By
default only Secure access is permitted, as the processor debug presents an opportunity for Non-secure code to
interfere with the Secure context and/or perform Secure bus accesses.
The self-hosted debug window starts at address 0x40140000 (CORESIGHT_PERIPH_BASE). The offsets of the APs within
this window are the same as the APs' addresses when accessed from the SW-DP.
Because of the blocking nature of the AHB-AP’s DRW register, and its interactions with the Cortex-M33’s arbitration of
AHB-AP accesses with load/stores, certain accesses have potential to cause bus lockup due to circular bus stall
dependencies. In particular, cores may not access their own AHB-APs through the self-hosted debug window, and AHB-
APs may not access AHB-APs through the self-hosted debug window — attempting to do so will immediately return a
bus fault. To reduce the opportunities for deadlock, a full APB crossbar is used to connect the SW-DP and the self-
hosted debug port to the APs, so that for example self-hosted use of the Arm trace hardware will not interfere with an
external debugger attaching via the AHB-APs.
3.5. Debug 87

```
There are some cases where a bus deadlock can not be avoided, such as a core using the other core’s AHB-AP, via the
self-hosted debug window, to access some other APB peripheral:
```
1. The access upstream of the APB’s DRW register will not complete until the downstream access completes
2. The downstream access will not complete until it is granted access to the system APB bridge
3. Access to the APB bridge will not be granted until the upstream access, which is occupying the system APB bridge,
    completes
4. See point 1.
This situation can arise when running a self-hosted debugger on one core, and debugging code on the other core which
accesses APB addresses. The deadlock is eventually broken when the APB bridge’s 65536-cycle timeout expires,
abandoning the transfer and returning a bus error to the origin of the upstream access. To avoid this, software should
detect when it is about to use an AP to access an APB address (an address starting with 0x4), and perform the access
directly instead of using the Mem-AP.
This type of deadlock does not occur when the debugger accesses the bus with RISC-V System Bus Access, because
the bus transfer upstream of the DM does not block on completion of the downstream access.

The trace subsystem captures trace messages from each of the Cortex-M33 ITM/ETM components, merges them into
a single trace bus, and sends off-chip through the 4-bit DDR trace port for subsequent capture and analysis by a trace
port analyser.
This allows the developer to review a detailed log of software executed on the processors. The advantage over
conventional hardware debug is that it does this without halting the processors or affecting their execution timing, so
you can diagnose software issues that are hard to reproduce under a debugger.
The trace subsystem comprises the following main components:

- Timestamp Generator: Timestamps propagate to both Cortex-M33 processors, and are applied to ETM and ITM
    output so that the relative timing of their trace streams can be recovered.
- Cortex-M33 ETM: Embedded Trace Macrocell, for real-time instruction flow messages generated from
    observations of the Cortex-M33’s execution.
- Cortex-M33 ITM: Instruction Trace Macrocell, for software-generated messages.
- ATB Funnel: Merges the Cortex-M33 trace sources into a single trace stream using the timestamps from the
    Timestamp Generator.
- TPIU: Trace Port Interface Unit, outputs trace data over trace port pins. The source-synchronous trace interface is
    4-bits DDR, up to 75 MHz clock, giving a maximum trace data rate of up to 600 Mb/s.
3.5. Debug 88

- Trace FIFO: Optionally captures the 32-bit TPIU trace stream on-device, from which point the DMA can transfer to
    main system SRAM.
See the Arm CoreSight ETM-M33 Technical Reference Manual for information about the Cortex-M33 ETM. See the SoC-
600M Technical Reference Manual for information about the other trace components in Figure 11
The trace output clock is fixed at one half of clk_sys. At the maximum system frequency of 150 MHz this yields a
75 MHz TPIU output clock. The trace throughput is reduced at lower system clock frequencies, though this is rarely an
issue in practice as the processor instruction throughput (and therefore the demand for trace output bandwidth) scales
accordingly.

###### 3.5.7.2. Trace FIFO

Trace output goes to one of two data sinks:

- The four-bit TPIU interface streams data out of the chip through GPIOs, for capture by an external probe
- The trace FIFO streams data into SRAM via the system DMA
The bandwidth of the DMA is greater than the bandwidth of the TPIU interface. Capturing into an on-chip buffer also
allows trace to operate through a comparatively low-speed SWD probe without restricting trace bandwidth.
The operation is similar to a micro-trace buffer (MTB). However, all of system SRAM is available for trace. You can also
use other DMA endpoints like the PIO and HSTX to implement your own trace data sinks, for example if you would
prefer a wider and lower-frequency bus than the TPIU provides.
You must enable DMA access to the trace FIFO registers by setting the DMA bit in the ACCESSCTRL CORESIGHT_TRACE
register before attempting to DMA from this FIFO. Configure the DMA for DREQ 53 to select the trace FIFO.

###### 3.5.7.3. List of trace FIFO registers

The trace FIFO registers start at a base address of 0x50700000 (defined as CORESIGHT_TRACE_BASE in the SDK).

The data captured into the FIFO is the full 32-bit TRACEDATA bus output by
the TPIU. Note that the TPIU is a DDR output at half of clk_sys, therefore this
interface can capture the full 32-bit TPIU DDR output bandwidth as it samples
once per active edge of the TPIU output clock.
RF 0x00000000

#### 3.5.8. Rescue reset

A rescue reset is a full system reset, similar to asserting the RUN pin low, which also sets a flag telling the bootrom to
halt before running any user software. This is performed over the SWD bus using the RP-AP, and can be performed even
when system clocks are stopped and the switched core power domain is powered down. This is used in the case where
the chip has locked up, for example if code has been programmed into flash which permanently halts the system clock:
since the debugger can no longer communicate with the processors to return the system to a working state, more
drastic action is needed. This functionality was provided by the Rescue DP on RP2040, but on RP2350 it is provided by
the RP-AP, to avoid mandatory use of multidrop SWD.
A rescue is invoked by setting and then clearing the CTRL.RESCUE_RESTART bit in the RP-AP. This causes a hard reset
of the chip, and sets CHIP_RESET.RESCUE_FLAG to indicate that a rescue reset took place. The bootrom checks this
flag almost immediately in the initial boot process (before watchdog, flash or USB boot), acknowledges by clearing the
bit, then halts the processor. This leaves the system in a safe state, with the system clock running, so that the debugger
can reattach to the cores and load fresh code.
3.5. Debug 90

#### 3.5.9. Security

```
By default, the SWD debug access port allows an external debugger to access all system memory and peripherals, and
to observe and change the execution of software running on the processors. If boot signature enforcement is enabled
(Section 10.1.1), debug access becomes a security concern, as it is able to sidestep this protection. To account for this,
RP2350 supports progressively locking down the debug port using configuration in on-chip OTP storage.
Conceptually there are two control bits: debug disable, and secure debug disable. Debug disable is intended to
completely cut off debug access to the processors and the system bus, whilst the secure debug disable forbids Secure
bus accesses, and halting of processors in the Secure state, but still allows Non-secure software to be debugged as
normal. There are two ways to set these control bits:
```
- Setting the relevant OTP critical flag: CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE or CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE to set the debug
    disable or secure debug disable, respectively
- Installing a 128-bit fixed debug key as OTP key 5 or 6 (Section 3.5.9.2)
OTP configuration changes take effect at the next reset of the OTP block.
Once debug has been disabled, software can re-enable debug using the OTP DEBUGEN register, which allows the secure
and overall debug enable to be cleared individually for each processor. For example, Secure software may implement a
shell where users can authenticate using a cryptographic challenge to enable debug on systems where it is disabled by
default. The DEBUGEN register belongs to the processor cold reset domain, so it is preserved over a PSM reset starting
from as early as OTP (the second PSM stage). This allows almost a full system reset without losing debug access.
To avoid accidental writes of the DEBUGEN register, its bits can be individually locked using the matching bits in
DEBUGEN_LOCK.
This offers increasing levels of debug protection:
1. Fully open: no keys installed and no OTP debug disable flags are set. This is the most convenient configuration for
product development.
2. Access with key only: at least one key is installed, but no OTP debug disable flags are set.
3. No access even with key (an OTP debug disable flag is set), but Secure code can enable debug access by writing
to DEBUGEN.
4. No access even with key (an OTP debug disable flag is set), and DEBUGEN is locked by DEBUGEN_LOCK.

###### 3.5.9.1. Effects of debug disables

The secure debug disable flag (CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE) has the following effects:

- Set Secure AP enable signals for Arm core 0 and core 1 AHB-APs to^0.

### ◦ This prevents the APs from performing Secure bus accesses (including to the PPB).

### ◦ Status is reported in the^ SDeviceEn^ flag of the AHB-AP^ CSW^ register.

- Set the Cortex-M33^ SPIDEN^ and^ SPNIDEN^ signals for both cores to^0.

### ◦ This prevents the cores from being halted or traced whilst in the Secure state.

- Disable the factory test JTAG interface (Section 10.10).
3.5. Debug 91

######  NOTE

```
Both AHB-APs' CSW.HNONSEC bits default to 0, generating Secure bus accesses. If the secure debug disable flag is set,
these bits must be set to 1 to generate Non-Secure bus accesses.
The debug disable flag (CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE) has all of the effects of the secure debug disable flag. It also has the
following additional effects:
```
- Set AP enable signals for Arm core 0 and core 1 AHB-APs to 0.

### ◦ This prevents the APs from performing any bus accesses at all (including to the PPB).

### ◦ Status is reported in the^ DeviceEn^ flag of the AHB-AP^ CSW^ register.

- Set AP enable signal for RISC-V DM APB-AP to 0.

### ◦ This prevents the AP from accessing the RISC-V Debug Module.

### ◦ Status is reported in the^ DeviceEn^ flag of the APB-AP^ CSW^ register.

- Set^ DBGEN^ and^ NIDEN^ signals for the CTI to 0.
On RISC-V CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE has no useful effect. Debug-mode accesses from the cores always have
Secure and Privileged bus attributes, except when reduced by FORCE_CORE_NS. Likewise, System Bus Access via the
Debug Module is always Secure and Privileged, unless FORCE_CORE_NS.CORE1 is set, in which case it is Non-secure
and Privileged. Use the CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE flag on RISC-V.

###### 3.5.9.2. Debug keys

```
Section 13.5.2 describes the OTP hardware access keys. Hardware reads OTP access keys into hidden registers as part
of the OTP power-up sequence which takes place after an OTP reset, and the corresponding OTP locations then
become inaccessible. OTP keys 5 and 6 are special in that they control access to the SWD debug hardware in addition to
functioning as normal OTP page keys.
A debug key is a 128-bit fixed challenge. Installing a debug key in OTP locks down debug access, and it remains locked
until the debug host writes a matching key value through the RP-AP DBGKEY register. This is a write-only interface.
To install a debug key, first program the OTP locations starting from KEY5_0 or KEY6_0. These locations are ECC-
protected. Once you have programmed the 128-bit key value and read it back to confirm the correct value is
programmed, write the raw bit pattern 0x010101 to KEY5_VALID or KEY6_VALID to mark the key as valid. The validity
takes effect at the next reset of the OTP block.
Once a key is valid, the OTP storage locations for that key become inaccessible for both reads and writes. Only the OTP
power-up state machine (Section 13.3.4) can read the key.
The effect of installing debug keys depends on which of key 5 and 6 are installed:
```
- If key 5 or key 6 is valid, and no matching key (either) has been entered through the RP-AP, all debug is disabled.
    This has the same effect as setting CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE.
- If key 5 is valid, and no matching key (key 5 specifically) has been entered through the RP-AP, Secure debug is
    disabled. This has the same effect as writing CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE.
When both keys are installed, key 5 provides both Secure and Non-secure debug access, and key 6 provides Non-secure
debug access only. When only a single key is installed, that key provides both Secure and Non-secure debug access.
To enter a key over SWD, first write a 1 to DBGKEY.RESET. Then sequentially write 128 bits to DBGKEY.DATA, each
accompanied by a 1 written to DBGKEY.PUSH. Write the data LSB-first, starting with the lowest-numbered OTP row.
Assuming you wrote a value that matched one of the installed debug keys, debug unlocks after the 128th push. The
SDeviceEn and DeviceEn flags in the Mem-AP CSW registers indicate success or failure.
Failure to supply a matching key through the RP-AP disables debug if it would otherwise be enabled. However, supplying
a key does not enable if it is already disabled for other reasons. For example, if CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE is set, and
3.5. Debug 92

DEBUGEN is clear, debug is be disabled no matter the state of the debug keys and the RP-AP.

#### 3.5.10. RP-AP

```
The RP-AP is a small register block which is always accessible over SWD. RP-AP access does not require the switched
core domain to be powered up, or any internal system clock generators to be running.
```
###### 3.5.10.1. List of registers

The RP-AP registers start at offset 0x80000 in the debug address space, which is accessed via address 0x80000 in the SW-
DP’s SELECT register. Unlike the other APs, it can not be accessed directly from the system bus.

If the LPOSC is inoperative or malfunctioning it may also be necessary to set

The sequencer timing is managed by the POWMAN_SEQ_* registers. See the header file for those registers for more
information on the timing.
Power up of the domain commences by clearing bit 0 (IS_PD) then bits 1-8 are set in sequence. Bit 8 (IS_PU)
indicates the sequence is complete.
Power down of the domain commences by clearing bit 8 (IS_PU) then bits 7-1 are cleared in sequence. Bit 0 (IS_PU)
is then set to indicate the sequence is complete.

Description
This register allows external control of the power sequencer outputs for all the switched power domains. If any of
the power sequencers stall at any stage then force power up operation of all domains by running this sequence:
```
- set DBG_POW_OVRD = 0x3b to force small power switches on, large power switches off, resets on and
    isolation on
- allow time for the domain power supplies to reach full rail
- set DBG_POW_OVRD = 0x3b to force large power switches on
- set DBG_POW_OVRD = 0x37 to remove isolation
- set DBG_POW_OVRD = 0x17 to remove resets

6 DBG_POW_RESTART_FROM_XOSC: By default the system begins boot as
soon as a clock is available from the ROSC, then it switches to the XOSC when
it is available. This is done because the XOSC takes several ms to start up. If
there is a problem with the ROSC then the default behaviour can be changed
to not use the ROSC and wait for XOSC. However, this requires a mask change
to modify the reset value of the Power Manager START_FROM_XOSC register.
To allow experimentation the default can be temporarily changed by setting
this register bit to 1. After setting this bit the core must be reset by a Coresight
dprst or a rescue reset (see RESCUE_RESTART in the RP_AP_CTRL register
above). A power-on reset, brown-out reset or RUN pin reset will reset this
control and revert to the default behaviour.

## 3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors

The Cortex-M33 features a coprocessor port which transfers up to 64 bits per cycle between the processor and certain
closely-coupled hardware. The Cortex-M33’s built-in floating-point unit is an example of such a coprocessor, but
RP2350 adds three device-specific coprocessors to this interface. The following sections document these
coprocessors.
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 100

```
Before accessing a coprocessor from Secure code, that coprocessor must first be enabled by setting the corresponding
bit in the CPACR. Before accessing from the Non-secure state, the corresponding bits in the NSACR and CPACR_NS
registers must be set.
The RISC-V processors on RP2350 do not have access to the Cortex-M33 coprocessors.
```
#### 3.6.1. GPIO coprocessor (GPIOC)

```
Coprocessor port 0 provides low-overhead access from the Cortex-M33 processors to the GPIO registers in the SIO
(Section 3.1.3). This enables a single coprocessor instruction to sample all 48 GPIOs, or to set/clear/write any single
GPIO, among other functionality.
Non-secure accesses are filtered according to the GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1 registers in ACCESSCTRL.
GPIOs not granted for Non-secure use will ignore writes from the Non-secure state, and read back as zero when read
from the Non-secure state.

```
###### 3.6.1.6. Interpreting instruction fields

The type of coprocessor instruction — mrc, mrrc, mcr and mcrr — specifies the direction of the transfer (read/write) and the
number of Arm registers being transferred (one or two).
Bits 3:2 of the first coprocessor register number field, CRm, identify the group of registers being accessed. Values 0, 1 and
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 103

```
2 refer to the output, output enable and input registers respectively.
Bit 0 of the first coprocessor register number field, CRm, may be used to distinguish which register in a group is being
accessed. Bit 1 is reserved to allow more registers to be indexed on future chips with more GPIOs.
For writes, bits 1:0 of the instruction’s opc1 field specify the type of write operation: values 0, 1, 2, 3 map to normal write,
XOR, set and clear operations respectively. Bits 3:2 of the opc1 field are used to indicate the addressing mode for the
register or individual bit being accessed. Their exact interpretation depends on the instruction.
Any combinations not listed in the preceding tables are reserved for future use.
```
#### 3.6.2. Double-precision coprocessor (DCP)

```
Each Cortex-M33 CPU core is equipped with two instances of a double-precision coprocessor that provides acceleration
of double-precision floating point operations including add, subtract, multiply, divide and square root. The design is
implemented in just a few thousand gates and so occupies much less silicon die area than a full double-precision
floating-point unit.
Nevertheless, these coprocessors considerably speed up basic double-precision operations compared to pure software
implementations. The coprocessors also offer support for some single-precision operations and conversions.
The two coprocessor instances are assigned to the Secure and Non-secure domains. Coprocessor number 4 always
maps to the coprocessor used for the current processor security state. Coprocessor number 5 always maps to the Non-
secure coprocessor instance, but is accessible only from Secure code. This duplication avoids saving and restoring the
coprocessor context during Secure/Non-secure state transitions.
```
###### 3.6.2.1. CPU interface

```
As with the other coprocessors, the accelerator connects to the CPU over a 64-bit bus. Two words of data can be
transferred per cycle over that bus using the following instructions:
```
- MCRR: move two integer registers to coprocessor
- MRRC: move two integer registers from coprocessor
There are also single-register versions of these instructions, including ones that allow the CPU’s flags to be loaded from
the coprocessor. The CPU issues CDP instructions to trigger operations within the coprocessor without transferring any
data.

###### 3.6.2.2. Internal architecture

A block diagram of the accelerator is shown in Figure 12.
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 104

Figure 12. Block
diagram of double-
precision accelerator
At the heart of the design are:

- two sets of registers, each designed to hold an unpacked double-precision value
- a 9-bit status register
Unlike a conventional FPU, the accelerator does not contain a full register bank. Not only does this save die area, it also
means that saving and restoring the coprocessor’s state is very fast: in fact, the entire state fits within six 32-bit words
and hence can be saved to, or restored from, the CPU in three instructions.
The accelerator contains a wide adder, capable of adding two mantissa values and three exponent values
simultaneously. There is also a shifter that can either perform a logical right shift by a given amount, or normalise a
denormalised mantissa and report the amount of shift required to do so. A considerable amount of hardware in the
shifter is shared between these two operating modes.
Control logic, shown at the top of the diagram, decodes coprocessor instructions and configures the accelerator’s
functional units and datapath multiplexers in order to execute the desired operation. Each coprocessor instruction takes
a single cycle, so coprocessor operations cannot stall the CPU.
A floating-point operation such as addition or subtraction is carried out by executing a fixed (or 'canned') sequence of
instructions as follows:
1. One or two MCRR instructions to write the operands to the coprocessor.
2. A number of CDP (and possibly other) instructions that together perform the operation itself.
3. An MRRC or MRC instruction to read back the result.
The hardware handles special cases involving zeroes, NaNs, and infinities, as well as rounding, underflow and overflow.
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 105

```
The accelerator does not contain a multiplier array, as that would occupy a considerable amount of die area. Instead,
the mantissas of the operands of a multiplication operation are brought back into the CPU to take advantage of the fast
long multiply instructions available there. The coprocessor handles the processing of exponents.
Division and square root operations also involve data moving back and forth between coprocessor and CPU. To assist
with these operations, the coprocessor contains two small lookup tables (implemented as random logic) that provide
initial approximations used in the divide and square root algorithms. The coprocessor handles the processing of
exponents.
The accelerator is only meant to be used with the canned instruction sequences that implement basic floating-point
operations. The state of the accelerator is not guaranteed to be preserved from the end of one canned sequence to the
beginning of the next: see the discussion of the 'engaged' flag in the status register below.
```
###### 3.6.2.3. Registers

```
X and Y mantissa registers
The X and Y mantissa registers (xm and ym) are each 64 bits wide. They can be read and written directly by the CPU;
the xm register can also store the lower part of the result from the adder. When a value is written to the coprocessor
using a 'write unpacked' MCRR instruction, the top two bits of the mantissa register are set to 01 and the next most
significant bits are filled from the mantissa field of the floating-point operand. The low-order bits of the mantissa
register are cleared.
X and Y exponent registers
The X and Y exponent registers (xe and ye) are each 14 bits wide. They can be read and written directly by the CPU;
the xe register can also store the higher part of the result from the adder. When a value is written to the coprocessor
using a 'write unpacked' MCRR instruction, the exponent register is set from the exponent field of the floating-point
operand.
X and Y flag registers
The X and Y flag registers (xf and yf) are each four bits wide. They can be read and written directly by the CPU. The
flag register stores information about the type of floating-point number represented in the corresponding mantissa
and exponent registers: its sign, whether it is a zero, whether it is an infinity, and whether it is a NaN. When a value
is written to the coprocessor using a 'write unpacked' MCRR instruction, the bits of the flag register are updated
according to the type of the floating-point operand.
Status register
The status register contains nine bits. It can be read and written directly by the CPU. The least significant six bits of
the register store the shift required to align the two operands of an addition or subtraction; the next two bits
indicate whether the value represented by (xe, xm) is greater than, equal to, or less than the value represented by
(ye, ym) - in other words, whether the magnitude of the value stored in the X registers is greater than, equal to, or
less than the magnitude of the value stored in the Y registers. These status bits are set in the first step of an
addition, subtraction or comparison operation after the operands have been loaded.
The final bit of the status register indicates whether the coprocessor is 'engaged'. The engaged flag is set by all
coprocessor instructions that occur at the beginning or in the middle of the canned instruction sequences. It is cleared
by those instructions used at the end of a canned sequence to read back a final result.
```
###### 3.6.2.4. State save and restore

An interrupt handler can test the engaged flag to determine whether it has pre-empted an in-progress operation on the
same coprocessor. If the engaged flag is set, the handler can save (and restore) the coprocessor state before using the
coprocessor. If the engaged flag is clear, the save (and restore) step can be skipped. If this approach is implemented,
the state of the accelerator must be regarded as undefined when not within one of the canned instruction sequences.
Three MRRC instructions are provided to copy the six words of state in the coprocessor into integer registers in the CPU,
from where they can, for example, be pushed onto the stack. The last of these instructions clears the engaged flag.
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 106

```
Similarly, three MCRR instructions are provided to restore the state of the coprocessor from integer registers, including the
state of the engaged flag.
```
###### 3.6.2.5. Instruction summary

As mentioned above, it is intended that the coprocessor instructions are only used as part of canned sequences.

###### 3.6.2.6. Example canned sequence

The assembly code sequence to implement a callable double-precision addition operation is shown in Table 112.

mrrc p4,#1,r0,r1,c0 RDDA r0,r1 read R0 and R1 packed double-precision from X, including
special-value processing for addition
bx r14 return from function
Logic in the coprocessor ensures, for example, that the ADD1 instruction shifts the smaller argument, that xm and ym are
negated as required before being sent to the adder, and that the larger exponent is used as the basis for the subsequent
normalisation.

###### 3.6.2.7. Using the coprocessor via the SDK library

```
The SDK pico_double library automatically uses the coprocessor for double-precision floating-point calculations. This is
the simplest way to take advantage of the coprocessor, but it entails a few cycles of overhead for each operation. Not
only is there the overhead involved in a function call and return, but for safety the general-purpose implementations in
the SDK always test the engaged flag, saving and restoring the coprocessor state to and from the stack as needed. That
ensures that the functions work correctly if used in interrupt handlers, without additional intervention.
```
###### 3.6.2.8. Using the coprocessor directly

The SDK includes macros to generate canned sequences for standard operations in the file dcp_canned.inc.S in the SDK.
These allow the callable double-precision addition operation listed above, for example, to be written as:
dcp_dadd_m r0,r1, r0,r1,r2,r3 @ result in r0,r1; operands in r0,r1 and r2,r3
bx r14
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 109

```
dcp_dadd_m is a macro which expands into the sequence of coprocessor instructions given above. This macro allows you
to specify the integer registers to be used for the operands and the result, which means that using these macros directly
not only avoids function call and return overhead, it also avoids the extra overhead associated with argument
marshalling.
The more complex macros also require you to specify 'scratch' registers that they can use for storing intermediate
results. The following function, which calculates the dot product of two three-element vectors of doubles pointed to by
R0 and R1, illustrates this:
push {r4-r9,r14}
ldrd r3,r4,[r0],#8 @ load x₀
ldrd r5,r6,[r1],#8 @ load y₀
dcp_dmul_m r7,r8, r3,r4,r5,r6, r3,r4,r5,r6,r12,r14,r9 @ compute x₀y₀ ①
ldrd r3,r4,[r0],#8 @ load x₁
ldrd r5,r6,[r1],#8 @ load y₁
dcp_dmul_m r3,r4, r3,r4,r5,r6, r3,r4,r5,r6,r12,r14,r9 @ compute x₁y₁ ①
dcp_dadd_m r7,r8, r3,r4,r7,r8 @ compute x₀y₀+x₁y₁
ldrd r3,r4,[r0],#8 @ load x₂
ldrd r5,r6,[r1],#8 @ load y₂
dcp_dmul_m r3,r4, r3,r4,r5,r6, r3,r4,r5,r6,r12,r14,r9 @ compute x₂y₂ ①
dcp_dadd_m r0,r1, r3,r4,r7,r8 @ compute x₀y₀+x₁y₁+x₂y₂ ②
pop {r4-r9,r15}
```
1. r3, r4, r5, r6, r12, r14, and r9 are scratch registers.
2. stores the result in r0, r1.

######  NOTE

This example does not check the engaged flag. If used in interrupt handlers or in multi-threaded applications, a
suitable test would have to be added. For example, see the SDK implementation of __aeabi_dadd for an efficient way
to do this. The test only needs to be performed once, at the beginning of the function, so the overhead in this case
would be relatively small.
The following example demonstrates how to use the coprocessor:

###### 3.6.2.9. IEEE 754 compliance

```
The canned instruction sequences provide IEEE-compliant operations with the exception that denormals are flushed to
zero on input and output. Zeroes, NaNs and infinities are correctly handled. Rounding is to nearest, even on tie.
Faster versions of division and square root operations, named ddiv_fast and dsqrt_fast respectively, are available. These
do not always give correctly rounded results but do have a guaranteed error before rounding of less than 0.5ulp ('units in
last place'), which in particular means that if there is an exact representation of the result then that is what is returned.

Figure 13. The

coprocessor
implements hardware-

phase pipeline is
closely coupled to the
Cortex-M33 pipeline. A
64-bit salt register
holds a once-per-boot
random number, which
is used to generate
and validate stack
canary values and
generate
pseudorandom delay
sequences on RCP
instructions. Other
comparison functions
provide more general
hardware-checked
assertion support.
The redundancy coprocessor (RCP) is used in the RP2350 bootrom to provide hardware-assisted mitigation against
fault injection and return-oriented programming attacks. This includes the following instructions:

- generate and validate stack canary values based on a per-boot random seed
- assert that certain points in the program are executed in the correct order without missing steps
- validate booleans stored as one of two valid bit patterns in a 32-bit word
- validate 32-bit integers stored redundantly in two words with an XOR parity mask
- halt the processor upon reaching a software-detected panic condition
Section 3.6.3.7 lists the RCP instruction set in full. RCP instruction encodings contain a parity bit; executing an invalid
instruction or an instruction with bad parity triggers an RCP fault.
Each Cortex-M33 processor is equipped with a single RCP instance, mapped as coprocessor number 7 in the
coprocessor opcode space. The two RCP instances are linked: an RCP fault on one core immediately triggers a fault on
the other. RCP faults have two steps:
1. The non-maskable interrupt (NMI) is asserted. It remains asserted until a warm reset of the processor.
2. Any further RCP instructions stall the coprocessor port until a warm reset of the processor. This stall cannot be
interrupted, as the processor is already in the NMI state.
The RP2350 bootrom implements the NMI and HardFault vectors with an rcp_panic instruction. This instruction
unconditionally stalls the coprocessor port. This prevents the processor from retiring any more instructions until either
a debugger connects to reset the processors, or the processors reset through some other mechanism (such as the
system watchdog timer). The processor quickly reaches a quiescent state that reduces vulnerability to further fault
injection (deliberate or otherwise).
Each core’s RCP has a 64-bit seed value (Section 3.6.3.1). The RCP uses this value to generate stack canary values and
to add short pseudorandom delays to RCP instructions. Both RCP instances are seeded by core 0 during the early boot
path in the bootrom using the system true-random number generator (Section 12.12). Running any RCP instruction
before providing a salt value triggers an RCP fault. The use of random data in stack canary values makes it difficult to
reuse return-oriented-programming stack payloads across multiple boots.
Figure 13 gives a dataflow-level overview of the RCP hardware. The RCP is structured as a two-phase pipeline which
overlays the Cortex-M33 execution pipeline. It exchanges data with the core via a 64-bit incoming bus (CPWDATA) and
a 32-bit outgoing bus (CPRDATA). The Cortex-M33 can issue two register reads to the coprocessor in one cycle through
the CPWDATA bus. The RCP leverages this throughput for some of its assertion instructions, such as rcp_iequal, which
raises a fault when two Arm registers do not contain the same 32-bit value.
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 113

```
The 8-bit tag value in Figure 13 is an 8-bit instruction immediate value encoded by the instruction CRn and CRm fields.
These 8-bit values are used to uniquely identify functions for canary value generation so that stack frames are not
interchangeable between functions. They also provide 8-bit counter values for rcp_count_set and rcp_count_check
instructions. Encoding the tags using the CRn and CRm fields makes RCP instruction sequences more compact, as it
obviates additional instructions to materialise these small constants in registers and pass them through CPWDATA.
This also makes the tag values less vulnerable to glitching, because the instruction opcode fields are available earlier in
the cycle than the register values passed on CPWDATA.
RCP instructions may also execute in the Non-secure state, with certain differences to prevent Non-secure code from
triggering RCP faults or observing the value of the salt register. This supports Non-secure software executing shared
ROM routines which contain RCP instructions, but does not allow probing of the RCP’s internal state from a Non-secure
context. Section 3.6.3.2 gives further details and rationale for Non-secure execution support.
Certain details are elided from Figure 13 for clarity, such as the delay counter used for pseudorandom instruction
delays, and the logic for suppressing faults under Non-secure execution. This behaviour is described in full in the
following sections.
```
###### 3.6.3.1. Salt register

```
Each RCP instance is provisioned with a 64-bit salt register, which provides a seed for stack canary values and random
instruction delays. This is expected to be initialised with a random value early in the boot process: the RP2350 bootrom
uses the true random number generator to generate the salt values.
Initially the salt register is in the invalid state. This state only allows the following operations:
```
- Checking the valid state of the salt register, via^ rcp_canary_status
- Writing a salt via^ rcp_salt_core0^ or^ rcp_salt_core1, which writes a 64-bit value to that core’s salt register, and
    changes its state to valid
When the salt register is in the invalid state, executing any RCP instruction other than those listed above unconditionally
triggers an RCP fault. This makes it difficult to skip RCP initialisation via fault injection, because the RP2350 bootrom
contains a high density of RCP instructions.
Similarly, attempting to write to an already-valid RCP salt register triggers an RCP fault. There is no reason to initialise
the RCP salt register twice, so this case is detected as an anomaly that indicates loss of control flow integrity.
Core 0’s coprocessor port writes the salt registers for both cores' RCP instances to simplify multicore interactions
during early boot. In the RP2350 bootrom, core 1’s first steps lock down its MPU execute permissions to a small region
of the ROM containing its wait-for-launch code, and then poll for its RCP salt to become valid once core 0 has cleared
boot memory, performed some minimal hardware setup, and generated the RCP salts.
When core 0 is switched to RISC-V architecture and core 1 is Arm, the core 1 salt register is forcibly marked as valid to
permit core 1 to execute the ROM. This has no impact on secure boot because RISC-V cores are only enabled when
secure boot is disabled; the ability to set core 0 to RISC-V already implies subversion of secure boot.

###### 3.6.3.2. Access from Non-secure

```
Setting bit 7 of the Cortex-M33 NSACR register permits Non-secure code to set bit 7 of CPACR_NS, which in turn enables Non-
secure access to the RCP. Non-secure RCP access is useful for executing shared Secure/Non-secure routines which
contain RCP instructions. For example, the memcpy implementation in the RP2350 bootrom is shared by Secure code in
the main boot path, and Non-secure code such as the USB bootloader.
Since an RCP fault is fatal for all software running on the system, Non-secure must not be able to trigger RCP faults at
will. Similarly, if Non-secure code were able to read out the RCP salt register, it would make it easier to engineer stack
payloads which can control Secure execution without triggering RCP faults. Therefore the RCP handles Non-secure
accesses differently from Secure:
```
- Masks read data to all-zeroes
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 114

- Ignores write data: any instruction which would generate a data-dependent RCP fault becomes a no-op
- Reports coprocessor errors instead of RCP faults for invalid instructions, which the processor maps to the Non-
    secure UNDEFINSTR UsageFault
- Skips the pseudorandom instruction delay: all RCP instructions execute in one cycle, assuming the Cortex-M33 is
    able to issue them at one instruction per cycle
The lack of pseudorandom instruction delays makes it more difficult for Non-secure code to extract the seed value used
to add delays to Secure execution of RCP instructions.

###### 3.6.3.3. Instruction validation

The RCP applies the following rules to all coprocessor instructions which target coprocessor 7 :

- The number of^1 bits in the^ Opc1^ field, plus the instruction parity bit, must be an even number.

### ◦ For^ mcr,^ mrc^ and^ cdp^ instructions, bit^0 of the^ Opc2^ field encodes the parity bit.

### ◦ For^ mcrr, bit^3 of the^ CRm^ field encodes the parity bit.

- The instruction must not be an^ mrrc^ (64-bit coprocessor-to-core)
- For^ mcr^ instructions (32-bit core-to-coprocessor):

### ◦ The^ Opc1^ field must be in the range 0 through 6.

### ◦ If there is no 8-bit tag (i.e. any other than^ rcp_canary_check,^ rcp_count_check,^ rcp_count_set), the^ CRn^ and^ CRm

opcode fields must be all-zeroes.

- For^ mrc^ instructions (32-bit coprocessor-to-core):

### ◦ The^ Opc1^ field must be in the range 0 through 2.

### ◦ For instructions other than^ rcp_canary_get^ and^ rcp_canary_check, the^ CRn^ and^ CRm^ opcode fields must be all-

zeroes.

- For^ mcrr^ instructions (64-bit core-to-coprocessor):

### ◦ The^ Opc1^ field must be in the range 0 through 8.

### ◦ For^ rcp_salt_core*^ instructions, bits^ 2:0^ of the^ CRm^ field must be 0 or 1 (referred to as^ rcp_salt_core0^ and

rcp_salt_core1 respectively).

### ◦ For all other^ mcrr^ instructions, bits^ 2:0^ of the^ CRm^ field must be 0.

```
The terms Opc1, Opc2, CRm and CRn in the description above refer to standard encoding fields in the Arm T32 instruction
encoding for coprocessor instructions. See the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual for full details of the encoding
and assembler syntax.
Any coprocessor instruction targeting coprocessor 7 that fails these validation rules will result in one of two outcomes,
depending on the security domain in which the instruction is executed:
```
- Secure execution of an invalid instruction is an immediate, unconditional RCP fault. The RCP asserts the core’s
    non-maskable interrupt signal, and any further RCP instructions stall the coprocessor port indefinitely. This
    continues until the core receives a warm reset. This also triggers RCP faults on other cores: for more information,
    see Section 3.6.3.4.
- Non-secure execution of an invalid instruction returns an error on the opcode-phase coprocessor interface, which
    is interpreted as a Non-secure UNDEFINSTR UsageFault by the core. For a full description of this Armv8-M-specific
    fault, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

###### 3.6.3.4. Cross-core triggering

An RCP fault indicates that the integrity of the software environment is compromised. Though the fault may originate on
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 115

```
a single processor, all processors which share the same trusted memory may behave unpredictably if they continue to
execute, since:
```
- The physical condition which caused one processor to misexecute in a detectable way, such as low supply voltage,
    may cause other processors to misexecute in a manner which was not detected.
- The processor which triggered an RCP fault may already have corrupted shared, trusted memory contents in a way
    that interferes with the other processor’s operation, (e.g. corrupting the other core’s stack).
Therefore, an RCP fault on one core also triggers an RCP fault on other cores. Because RP2350 has two cores, an RCP
fault on core 0 always triggers a fault on core 1, and an RCP fault on core 1 always triggers a fault on core 0.

Each core locally ORs in the trigger signal from the other core. The outputs of the two OR gates on the left are logically
equivalent, but the gates are kept local to the core to minimise delay routing the core’s own fault trigger to its own fault
register.

###### 3.6.3.5. Stack canary values

Canaries are values written to the stack on function entry and validated on function exit, to assure that:

- The exit matches the entry (i.e. when leaving through the back door, you entered through the front door)
- The stack was not completely overwritten in the course of executing the function
This helps to mitigate two classes of attack:
- Fault injection: any physical fault condition which corrupts the program counter or causes a wild indirect branch is
likely to cause the processor to execute a function epilogue which does not match the prologue. Any branch into
the middle of a function is likely to eventually reach the epilogue.
- Return-oriented programming: deliberate stack corruption can redirect control flow through a sequence of function
tails which perform arbitrary operations. The stack may be corrupted by exploiting missing bounds checks on
stack buffer operations. Random canary values make it difficult to craft such a stack payload.
Return-oriented programming mitigation is particularly important to account for in the bootrom because the bootrom
exposes an API surface that is mapped at a known location at runtime (it is physically always mapped at 0x00000000).
This provides a well-known exploit surface similar to the C standard library.
The RCP supports canary values with two canary-specific instructions:
- rcp_canary_get^ generates a 32-bit value for an 8-bit tag as a function of the salt register
- rcp_canary_check^ validates a 32-bit value for an 8-bit tag and raises an RCP fault if the value does not match that
produced by an rcp_canary_get for the same tag.
The 32-bit canary value is as follows:
- Bits^ 7:0: all-zero
- Bits^ 15:8: XOR of bits^ 7:0^ of the salt with (AND of bits^ 31:24^ of the salt with the 8-bit tag)
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 116

- Bits^ 23:16: XOR of bits^ 15:8^ of the salt with (AND of bits^ 39:32^ of the salt with the bitwise NOT of the 8-bit tag)
- Bits^ 31:24: XOR of bits^ 23:16^ of the salt with the 8-bit tag
The following code demonstrates how you might calculate the 32-bit canary value in C:
uint32_t canary_value(uint64_t salt, uint8_t tag) {
uint32_t tag_expanded =
(uint32_t)tag |
((uint32_t)~tag << 8)
((uint32_t)tag << 16);
tag_expanded &= (0xff0000u | ((salt >> 24) & 0x00ffffu));
uint32_t result24 = tag_expanded ^ salt;
return result24 << 8;
}
This canary value is chosen such that:
- Different tags are guaranteed to yield different canary values
- For any two different tags, each is a function of at least one salt bit that the other is not a function of (so it is
difficult to calculate canaries for different tags even if one value is known)
- Null-terminated string operations on the stack terminate before reading or writing a canary
Each function should use a different canary tag, to prevent a stack frame for one function being used to return through
another function’s epilogue. Avoid using canary values for purposes other than stack canaries.
The RP2350 bootrom uses 8-bit tags in the range 0x40 through 0xbf. The remaining tags are free for use in user code.

###### 3.6.3.6. Pseudorandom instruction delays

```
By default, all RCP instructions execute with a pseudorandom delay in the range of 0 to 127 cycles. These delays make
it more difficult for an outside observer to precisely time a fault injection event with respect to an RCP instruction, or the
critical code path it protects.
```
######  NOTE

In certain usage situations, RCP delays can expose a side-channel where processor state can be inferred. See
RP2350-E26 for details.
Setting bit 12 of the first halfword of an instruction disables the pseudorandom delay for that instruction only. The
instruction executes in a single cycle, assuming the Cortex-M33 does not insert stall cycles due to other micro-
architectural constraints. To set this bit, assemble the *2 variant of any given coprocessor instruction ( e.g. mrc2 rather
than mrc). In the NonSecure state, RCP instructions always execute without delay.
The RCP implements instruction execution delays by stalling the coprocessor opcode interface during the opcode
phase (shown in the Figure 13 pipeline diagram). The Cortex-M33 may choose to abandon a stalled coprocessor
instruction due to an interrupt. When this happens, the delay counter continues counting down, waiting for the delay
period to elapse. If the Cortex-M33 issues another RCP instruction whilst the delay counter is still running (either in the
interrupt, or after returning to the interrupted RCP instruction), this instruction executes once the existing countdown
completes. However, if the delay counter of an abandoned instruction has already expired before the next RCP
instruction executes, the next instruction samples a pseudorandom delay count, and begins a new countdown.
The pseudorandom delay sequence is a function of bits 63:40 of the salt value. As such, the pattern of delays is unique
per-boot, provided each boot writes a different 64-bit value to the salt register.
The pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) used for delays implements a number of small linear feedback shift
registers (LFSRs) in bits 63:40 of the salt register, and returns a nonlinear function of the 24-bit state. The LFSR feedback
functions on the 24-bit state are:
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 117

- Bits^ 23:20: 4-bit LFSR with taps^ 0xc
- Bits^ 19:15: 5-bit LFSR with taps^ 0x14
- Bits^ 14:8: 7-bit LFSR with taps^ 0x60
- Bits^ 7:0: 8-bit LFSR with taps^ 0xb4
The LFSRs are implemented by shifting the XOR reduction of (state AND taps) into the LSB with each state update.
When an LFSR’s state is all-zeroes, a one bit is shifted into the LSB. The LFSR state advances each time a random
number is generated: this happens when executing an instruction with a pseudorandom delay, or when executing a
rcp_random_byte instruction.
Each bit of the pseudorandom output is the XOR of six bits of the 24-bit state, XORed with the majority-3 vote of three
other bits of the state:
Output Bit XOR Taps Majority-3 Taps
7 7 17 6 16 13 8 9 12 21
6 14 21 19 6 16 13 4 14 6
5 7 5 2 18 11 1 18 14 7
4 4 19 17 0 18 7 18 11 3
3 23 12 7 16 14 5 17 3 15
2 15 13 20 21 8 12 7 22 9
1 4 16 11 18 9 6 14 21 16
0 11 3 4 19 10 14 1 2 9
Bits 6:0 of this function are used for pseudorandom instruction delays, producing delays in the range of 0 to 127 cycles.
The delay is applied in addition to the one-cycle base cost of executing a coprocessor instruction. The full 8-bit result is
available through the rcp_random_byte instruction.
This is a simple pseudorandom number generator which makes it difficult to recover the initial 24-bit state from a small
number of observations. It accomplishes this by making the observation size much smaller than the state size and
using a non-linear combination function for the output. It has a number of statistical aberrations which make it
unsuitable for general random number generation (not to mention its small state size). For high-quality random number
generation, either use the system true-random number generator (TRNG) directly, or use a high-quality software PRNG
with a large state seeded from the TRNG.
Note that the 24 MSBs of the salt value used to seed the delay PRNG do not overlap with the 40 LSBs used to generate
stack canary values. Therefore measuring the random delays externally provides no information on the canary values.

###### 3.6.3.7. Instruction listing

```
The Cortex-M33 processors access the RCP using mcr, mcrr, mrc, and cdp instructions. The Armv8-M Architecture
Reference Manual describes the intricacies of these instructions in relation to the processor’s architectural state, but
from the coprocessor’s point of view:
```
- mcr^ writes a 32-bit value to the coprocessor from a single Arm integer register
- mcrr^ writes a 64-bit value to the coprocessor from a pair of Arm integer registers
- mrc^ reads a 32-bit value from the coprocessor, writing to either a single Arm integer register or to the processor
    status flags
- cdp^ performs some internal coprocessor operation without exchanging data with the processor
For each mcr, mcrr, mrc and cdp instruction, the RCP also accepts the matching mcr2, mcrr2, mrc2, and cdp2 opcode variant.
These opcodes differ only in bit 12. The plain versions have a pseudorandom delay of up to 127 cycles on their
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 118

execution, whereas the 2 -suffixed versions have no such delay.
Most RCP instructions are in the form of hardware-checked assertions. The phrase "asserts that" in the following
instruction listings means that, if some asserted condition is not true, the coprocessor raises an RCP fault.
3.6.3.7.1. Initialisation
rcp_salt_core0
Asserts that the core 0 salt register is currently invalid. Writes a 64-bit value, and marks it as valid.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #8, Rt, Rt2, c0
Rt is the 32 LSBs of the salt, Rt2 is the 32 MSBs.
rcp_salt_core1
Asserts that the core 1 salt register is currently invalid. Writes a 64-bit value, and marks it as valid.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #8, Rt, Rt2, c1
rcp_canary_status
Returns a true or false bit pattern (0xa500a500 or 0x00c300c3 respectively) that indicates whether the salt register for
this core has been initialised.
Opcode:
mrc p7, #1, Rt, c0, c0, #0
Invoking with Rt = 0xf sets the Arm N and C flags if and only if the salt register is valid.
If the salt has not been initialised, any operation other than initialising the salt or checking the canary status triggers
an RCP fault.
This opcode is used on core 0 to skip the RCP initialisation sequence if the bootrom has been re-entered without a
reset under debugger control, and on core 1 to wait for its RCP salt to be initialised.
3.6.3.7.2. Canary
rcp_canary_get
Gets a 32-bit canary value as a function of the salt register and the 8-bit tag encoded by two 4-bit coprocessor
register numbers CRn and CRm. CRn contains the four MSBs, CRm the four LSBs.
Opcode:
mrc p7, #0, Rt, CRn, CRm, #1
Section 3.6.3.5 specifies the 32-bit value returned by this instruction, but you should treat this as an opaque value to
be consumed by rcp_canary_check.
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 119

rcp_canary_check
Asserts that a value matches the result of an rcp_canary_get with the same 8-bit tag. The tag is encoded by two 4-bit
coprocessor register numbers, CRn and CRm. CRn contains the four MSBs, CRm the four LSBs.
Opcode:
mcr p7, #0, Rt, CRn, CRm, #1
3.6.3.7.3. Boolean validation
The RCP defines 0xa500a500 as the true value for 32-bit booleans, and 0x00c300c3 as the false value. All other bit patterns
are poison, and trigger an RCP fault when consumed by any RCP boolean instructions. These values are chosen as they
are valid immediates in Armv8-M Main.
This provides limited runtime type checking to ensure that boolean values are used in boolean contexts. The RP2350
bootrom occasionally uses redundant operations to generate booleans in a way that results in an invalid bit pattern if
the two redundant operations do not return the same value, such as when checking boot flags in OTP.
rcp_bvalid
Asserts that Rt is a valid boolean (0xa500a500 or 0x00c300c3).
Opcode:
mcr p7, #1, Rt, c0, c0, #0
rcp_btrue
Asserts that Rt is true (0xa500a500).
Opcode:
mcr p7, #2, Rt, c0, c0, #0
rcp_bfalse
Asserts that Rt is false (0x00c300c3).
Opcode:
mcr p7, #3, Rt, c0, c0, #1
rcp_b2valid
Asserts that Rt and Rt2 are both valid booleans.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #0, Rt, Rt2, c8
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 120

rcp_b2and
Asserts that Rt and Rt2 are both true.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #1, Rt, Rt2, c0
rcp_b2or
Asserts that both Rt and Rt2 are valid, and at least one is true.
mcrr p7, #2, Rt, Rt2, c0
rcp_bxorvalid
Asserts that Rt XOR Rt2 is a valid boolean. The XOR mask is generally a fixed bit pattern used to validate the origin
of the boolean, such as a return value from a critical function.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #3, Rt, Rt2, c8
rcp_bxortrue
Asserts that Rt XOR Rt2 is true.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #4, Rt, Rt2, c0
rcp_bxorfalse
Asserts that Rt XOR Rt2 is false.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #5, Rt, Rt2, c8
3.6.3.7.4. Integer Validation
rcp_ivalid
Asserts that Rt XOR Rt2 is equal to 0x96009600. This is used to validate 32-bit integers stored redundantly in two
memory words. The XOR difference provides assurance that two parallel chains of integer operations have not
mixed.
Opcode:
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 121

mcrr p7, #6, Rt, Rt2, c8
rcp_iequal
Asserts that Rt is equal to Rt2. Useful for general software assertions that are worth checking in hardware.
Opcode:
mcrr p7, #7, Rt, Rt2, c0
3.6.3.7.5. Random
rcp_random_byte
Returns a random 8-bit value generated from the upper 24 bits of the 64-bit salt value. Bits 31:8 of the result are all-
zero.
Opcode:
mrc p7, #2, Rt, c0, c0, #0
This is the same PRNG used for random delay values. It is mainly exposed for debugging purposes, and should not
be used for general software RNG purposes because the 24-bit state space is inadequate for scenarios where the
quality and predictability of the random numbers is important.
This instruction never has an execution delay. Once the Cortex-M33 issues the coprocessor access, it always
completes in one cycle.
3.6.3.7.6. Sequence count checking
These instructions are used to assert that a sequence of operations happens in the correct order. The count is
initialised to an 8-bit value at the beginning of such a sequence, then repeatedly checked, incrementing with each check.
If the 8-bit check value does not match the current counter value, the coprocessor raises an RCP fault.
rcp_count_set
Writes an 8-bit count value to the RCP sequence counter. Encodes the 8-bit value using two 4-bit coprocessor
numbers: CRn provides the MSBs, CRm the LSBs.
Opcode:
mcr p7, #4, r0, CRn, CRm, #0
rcp_count_check
Asserts that an 8-bit count value matches the current value of the RCP sequence counter. Increments the counter
by one, wrapping back to 0x00 after reaching 0xff. Encodes the 8-bit count value using two 4-bit coprocessor
numbers: CRn provides the MSBs, CRm the LSBs.
Opcode:
3.6. Cortex-M33 coprocessors 122

```
mcr p7, #5, r0, CRn, CRm, #1
3.6.3.7.7. Panic
rcp_panic
Stalls the coprocessor port forever. If the processor abandons the coprocessor access, asserts NMI and continues
stalling the coprocessor port. Also immediately raises an RCP fault on other cores.
Opcode:
cdp p7, #0, c0, c0, c0, #1
Software executes an rcp_panic instruction when it detects a condition that makes it unsafe to continue executing
the current program. The RCP responds by stalling the processor’s CDP access forever, which should cause the
processor to stop fetching and executing instructions.
The processor is allowed to abandon a stalled coprocessor instruction when interrupted, which may cause it to
continue executing in an unsafe state. The RCP responds to an abandoned transfer by asserting the non-maskable
interrupt, pre-empting the interrupt handler that caused the coprocessor access to be abandoned. This should
swiftly encounter another RCP instruction and once again stall the processor, this time without allowing
interruption.
Panic is specified in this way, instead of gating the processor clock, so the debugger can still attach cleanly to the
processor after a panic.
```
#### 3.6.4. Floating point unit

```
The Cortex-M33 cores on RP2350 are configured with the standard Arm single-precision floating point unit (FPU).
Coprocessor ports 10 and 11 access the FPU.
The Arm floating point extension is documented in the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.
Applications built with the SDK use the FPU automatically by default. For example, calculations with the float data type
in C automatically use the standard FPU, while calculations with the double data type automatically use the RP2350
double-precision coprocessor (Section 3.6.2).
```

###### 3.7.2.1. Modifications by Raspberry Pi

```
3.7.2.1.1. UNCROSS_I_D
The original Cortex-M33 processor design routes the following operations to either the Code or System port:
```
- instruction fetch
- load/stores
- debugger accesses
Accesses below address 0x20000000 route to the Code port. All other accesses route to the System port.
This routing strategy makes contention possible on both the internal bus matrix and the main system AHB5 crossbar.
The Cortex-M33 Technical Reference Manual describes this strategy in detail.
In RP2350, Raspberry Pi modified the Cortex-M33 bus matrix to:
- route all instruction fetch operations to the Code port
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 125

- route all load/stores and debugger accesses to the System port
This eliminates internal conflicts and improves performance in certain software use cases, e.g. when allocating both
code and data from a single unified SRAM pool.
In Section 3.7.2, we refer to this feature as UNCROSS_I_D.
There are no other modifications to the Cortex-M33 processor.

######  NOTE

```
This datasheet may refer to the Cortex-M33 Code and System ports as the instruction and data ports respectively (I
and D), to reflect this modification to the core’s integrated bus matrix.
```
###### 3.7.2.2. Interfaces

The processor has various external interfaces:
Code and System AHB interfaces
Harvard AHB bus architecture supporting exclusive transactions and security state.
System AHB interface
The System AHB (S-AHB) interface is used for any instruction fetch and data access to the memory-mapped SRAM,
Peripheral, External RAM and External device, or Vendor_SYS regions of the Armv8-M memory map.
Code AHB interface
The Code AHB (C-AHB) interface is used for any instruction fetch and data access to the Code region of the Armv8-
M memory map.
External Private Peripheral Bus
The External PPB (EPPB) APB interface enables access to CoreSight-compatible debug and trace components in a
system connected to the processor.
Secure attribution interface
The processor has an interface that connects to an external Implementation Defined Attribution Unit (IDAU), which
enables your system to set security attributes based on address.
ATB interfaces
The ATB interfaces output trace data for debugging. The ATB interfaces are compatible with the CoreSight
architecture. See the Arm CoreSight Architecture Specification v2.0 for more information. The instruction ATB
interface is used by the ETM, and the instrumentation ATB interface is used by the Instrumentation Trace Macrocell
(ITM).
Micro Trace Buffer interfaces
The Micro Trace Buffer (MTB) AHB slave interface and SRAM interface are for the CoreSight Micro Trace Buffer.
Coprocessor interface
The coprocessor interface is designed for closely coupled external accelerator hardware.
Debug AHB interface
The Debug AHB (D-AHB) slave interface allows a debugger access to registers, memory, and peripherals. The D-
AHB interface provides debug access to the processor and the complete memory map.
Cross Trigger Interface
The processor includes a Cross Trigger Interface (CTI) Unit that has an interface that is suitable for connection to
external CoreSight components using a Cross Trigger Matrix (CTM).
Power control interface
The processor supports a number of internal power domains that can be enabled and disabled using Q-channel
interfaces connected to a Power Management Unit (PMU) in the system.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 126

###### 3.7.2.3. Security attribution and memory protection

```
The Cortex-M33 processor supports the Armv8-M Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA) that provides
programmable support for memory protection using a number of software controllable regions. RP2350 supports 8
programmable regions.
PMSA allows privileged software to assign access permissions to a memory region. When unprivileged software
attempts to access the region, a fault exception is triggered. PMSA includes fault status registers that allow an
exception handler to determine the source of the fault, apply corrective action, and notify the system. This reduces the
potential impact of incorrectly-written application code.
The Cortex-M33 processor also includes support for defining memory regions as Secure or Non-secure, as defined in
the Armv8-M Security Extension. This protects memory regions from accesses with an inappropriate level of security.
```
###### 3.7.2.4. Floating-point unit (FPU)

The FPU provides:

- Instructions for single-precision (C programming language float type) data-processing operations
- Instructions for double-precision (C programming language double type) load and store operations
- Combined multiply-add instructions for increased precision (Fused MAC)
- Hardware support for conversion, addition, subtraction, multiplication, accumulate, division, and square-root
- Hardware support for denormals and all IEEE Standard 754-2008 rounding modes
- Thirty-two 32-bit single-precision registers or sixteen 64-bit double-precision registers
- Lazy floating-point context save
3.7.2.4.1. Lazy floating-point context save
This FPU function delays automated stacking of floating-point state until the ISR attempts to execute a floating-point
instruction. This reduces the latency to enter the ISR and removes floating-point context save for ISRs that do not use
floating-point.

###### 3.7.2.5. NVIC

```
The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller NVIC prioritizes external interrupt signals. Software can set the priority of each
interrupt. The NVIC and the Cortex-M33 processor core are closely coupled, providing low latency interrupt processing
and efficient processing of late arriving interrupts.
```
######  NOTE

"Nested" refers to the fact that interrupts can themselves be interrupted, by higher-priority interrupts. "Vectored"
refers to the hardware dispatching each interrupt to a distinct handler routine specified by a vector table. For more
details about nesting and vectoring behaviour, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.
All NVIC registers are only accessible using word transfers. Any attempt to read or write a halfword or byte individually
is unpredictable.
NVIC registers are always little-endian.
The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) is closely integrated with the core to achieve low-latency interrupt
processing.
Functions of the NVIC include:
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 127

- External interrupts, configurable from 1 to 480 using a contiguous or non-contiguous mapping. This is configured
    at implementation.
- Configurable levels of interrupt priority from 8 to 256. This is configured at implementation.
- Dynamic reprioritisation of interrupts.
- Priority grouping. This enables selection of pre-empting interrupt levels and non-pre-empting interrupt levels.
- Support for tail-chaining and late arrival of interrupts. This enables back-to-back interrupt processing without the
    overhead of state saving and restoration between interrupts.
- Support for the Armv8-M Security Extension. Secure interrupts can be prioritized above any Non-secure interrupt.

###### 3.7.2.6. Cross Trigger Interface Unit (CTI)

The CTI enables the debug logic, MTB, and ETM to interact with each other and with other CoreSight ™ components.

###### 3.7.2.7. ETM

The ETM provides instruction-only capabilities.

###### 3.7.2.8. MTB

```
The MTB provides a simple low-cost execution trace solution for the Cortex-M33 processor.
Trace is written to an SRAM interface, and can be extracted using a dedicated AHB slave interface (M-AHB) on the
processor. The MTB can be controlled by memory-mapped registers in the PPB region or by events generated by the
DWT or through the CTI.
See the Arm CoreSight MTB-M33 Technical Reference Manual for more information.
```
###### 3.7.2.9. Debug and trace

```
Debug and trace components include a configurable Breakpoint Unit (BPU) used to implement breakpoints and a
configurable Data Watchpoint and Trace (DWT) unit used to implement watchpoints, data tracing, and system profiling.
Other debug and trace components include:
```
- ITM for support of^ printf()^ style debugging, using instrumentation trace
- Interfaces suitable for:

### ◦ Passing on-chip data through a Trace Port Interface Unit (TPIU) to a Trace Port Analyzer (TPA) via a 4-bit DDR

output selected as a GPIO function (see Section 3.5.7)

### ◦ A ROM table to allow debuggers to determine which components are implemented in the Cortex-M33

processor

### ◦ Debugger access to all memory and registers in the system, including access to memory-mapped devices,

```
access to internal core registers when the core is halted, and access to debug control registers even when
reset is asserted

```
###### 3.7.3.5. Floating-point unit

The Cortex-M33 processor with FPU supports single-precision arithmetic as defined by the FPv5 architecture that is part
of the Armv8-M architecture. The FPU provides floating-point computation functionality compliant with ANSI/IEEE
Standard 754-2008, IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.
The FPU supports single-precision add, subtract, multiply, divide, multiply and accumulate, and square root operations.
It also provides conversions between fixed-point and floating-point data formats, and floating-point constant
instructions.
The FPU provides an extension register file containing 32 single-precision registers.
The registers can be viewed as:
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 129

- Thirty-two 32-bit single-word registers,^ S0-S31
- Sixteen 64-bit double-word registers,^ D0-D15
- A combination of registers from these views
3.7.3.5.1. FPU modes
The FPU provides full-compliance, flush-to-zero, and Default NaN modes of operation. In full-compliance mode, the FPU
processes all operations according to the IEEE 754 standard in hardware.
Modes of operation are controlled using the Floating-Point Status and Control Register, FPSCR.
Setting the FPSCR.FZ bit enables Flush-to-Zero (FZ) mode. In FZ mode, the FPU treats all subnormal input operands of
arithmetic operations as zeros. Exceptions that result from a zero operand are signalled appropriately. VABS, VNEG, and
VMOV are not considered arithmetic operations and are not affected by FZ mode. When an operation yields a tiny result
(as described in the IEEE 754 standard, where the destination precision is smaller in magnitude than the minimum
normal value before rounding) FZ mode replaces the result with a zero.
The FPSCR.IDC bit indicates when an input flush occurs.
The FPSCR.UFC bit indicates when a result flush occurs.
Setting the FPSCR.DN bit enables Default NaN (DN) mode. In NaN mode, the result of any arithmetic data processing
operation that involves an input NaN, or that generates a NaN result, returns the default NaN. All arithmetic operations
except for VABS, VNEG, and VMOV ignore the fraction bits of an input NaN.
Setting neither the FPSCR.DN bit nor the FPSCR.FZ bit enables full-compliance mode. In full-compliance mode, FPv5
functionality is compliant with the IEEE 754 standard in hardware.
For more information about the FPU and FPSCR, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.
3.7.3.5.2. FPU exceptions
The FPU sets the cumulative exception status flag in the FPSCR register as required for each instruction, in accordance
with the FPv5 architecture. The FPU does not support exception traps.
The processor has six output pins. By default, they are disconnected. Each reflect the status of one of the cumulative
exception flags:
FPIXC
Masked floating-point inexact exception.
FPUFC
Masked floating-point underflow exception.
FPOFC
Masked floating-point overflow exception.
FPDZC
Masked floating-point divide by zero exception.
FPIDC
Masked floating-point input denormal exception.
FPIOC
Invalid operation.
When a floating-point context is active, the stack frame extends to accommodate the floating-point registers. To reduce
the additional interrupt latency associated with writing the larger stack frame on exception entry, the processor
supports lazy stacking. This means that the processor reserves space on the stack for the FP state, but does not save
that state information to the stack unless the processor executes an FPU instruction inside the exception handler.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 130

```
The lazy save of the FP state is interruptible by a higher priority exception. The FP state saving operation starts over
after that exception returns.
3.7.3.5.3. Low power FPU operation
If the FPU is in a separate power domain, the way the FPU domain powers down depends on whether the FPU domain
includes state retention logic.
To power down the FPU:
```
- If FPU domain includes state retention logic, disable the FPU by clearing the^ CPACR.CP10^ and^ CPACR.CP11^ bitfields.
- If FPU domain does not include state retention logic, disable the FPU by clearing the^ CPACR.CP10^ and^ CPACR.CP11
    bitfields and set both the CPPWR.SU10 and CPPWR.SU11 bitfields to 1.

 (^) WARNING
Setting the CPPWR.SU10 and CPPWR.SU11 bitfields indicates that FPU state can be lost.

#### 3.7.4. Programmer’s model

```
The Cortex-M33 programmer’s model is an implementation of the Armv8-M Main Extension architecture.
For a complete description of the programmers model, refer to the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual, which also
contains the Armv8-M Thumb instructions. In addition, other options of the programmers model are described in the
System Control, MPU, NVIC, FPU, Debug, DWT, ITM, and TPIU feature topics.
```
###### 3.7.4.1. Modes of operation and execution

```
The Cortex-M33 processor supports Secure and Non-secure security states, Thread and Handler operating modes, and
can run in either Thumb or Debug operating states. In addition, the processor can limit or exclude access to some
resources by executing code in privileged or unprivileged mode.
See the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual for more information about the modes of operation and execution.
3.7.4.1.1. Security states
With the Armv8-M Security Extension, the programmer’s model includes two orthogonal security states: Secure state
and Non-secure state. The processor always resets into Secure state. Each security state includes a set of independent
operating modes and supports both privileged and unprivileged user access. Registers in the System Control Space are
banked across Secure and Non-secure state, with a Non-secure register view available to Secure state at an aliased
address.
3.7.4.1.2. Operating modes
For each security state, the processor can operate in Thread or Handler mode. The following conditions cause the
processor to enter Thread or Handler mode:
```
- The processor enters Thread mode on reset, or as a result of an exception return to Thread mode. Privileged and
    Unprivileged code can run in Thread mode.
- The processor enters Handler mode as a result of an exception. In Handler mode, all code is privileged.
The processor can change security state on taking an exception, for example when a Secure exception is taken from
Non-secure state, the Thread mode enters the Secure state Handler mode. The processor can also call Secure functions
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 131

```
from Non-secure state and Non-secure functions from Secure state. The Security Extension includes requirements for
these calls to prevent Secure data from being accessed in Non-secure state.
3.7.4.1.3. Operating states
The processor can operate in Thumb or Debug state:
```
- Thumb state is the state of normal execution running 16-bit and 32-bit halfword- aligned Thumb instructions.
- Debug state is the state when the processor is in Halting debug.
3.7.4.1.4. Privileged access and unprivileged user access
Code can execute as privileged or unprivileged. Unprivileged execution limits resource access appropriate to the current
security state. Privileged execution has access to all resources available to the security state. Handler mode is always
privileged. Thread mode can be privileged or unprivileged.

###### 3.7.4.2. Instruction set summary

The processor implements the following instruction from Armv8-M:

- All base instructions
- All instructions in the Main Extension
- All instructions in the Security Extension
- All instructions in the DSP Extension
- All single-precision instructions and double precision load/store instructions in the Floating-point Extension
For more information about Armv8-M instructions, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

###### 3.7.4.3. Memory model

The processor contains a bus matrix that arbitrates instruction fetches and memory accesses from the processor core
between the external memory system and the internal System Control Space (SCS) and debug components.
Priority is usually given to the processor to keep debug accesses as non-intrusive as possible.
The system memory map is Armv8-M Main Extension compliant, and is common both to the debugger and processor
accesses.
The default memory map provides user and privileged access to all regions except for the Private Peripheral Bus (PPB).
The PPB space only allows privileged access.
The following table shows the default memory map. This is the memory map used when the included MPUs are
disabled. The attributes and permissions of all regions, except that targeting the NVIC and debug components, can be
modified using an implemented MPU.
Table 114. Default
memory map Address Range (inclusive)^ Region^ Interface
0x00000000 - 0x1FFFFFFF Code Instruction and data accesses.
0x20000000 - 0x3FFFFFFF SRAM Instruction and data accesses.
0x40000000 - 0x5FFFFFFF Peripheral Instruction and data accesses. Any attempt to execute instructions
from the peripheral and external device region results in a
MemManage fault.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 132

```
Address Range (inclusive) Region Interface
0x60000000 - 0x9FFFFFFF External RAM Instruction and data accesses. Any attempt to execute instructions
from the peripheral and external device region results in a
MemManage fault.
0xA0000000 - 0xDFFFFFFF External device Instruction and data accesses. Any attempt to execute instructions
from the peripheral and external device region results in a
MemManage fault.
0xE0000000 - 0xE00FFFFF PPB Reserved for system control and debug. Cannot be used for
exception vector tables. Data accesses are either performed
internally or on EPPB. Accesses in the range 0xE0000000 - 0xE0043FFF
are handled within the processor. Accesses in the range 0xE0044000
```
- 0xE00FFFFF appear as APB transactions on the EPPB interface of
the processor. Any attempt to execute instructions from the region
results in a MemManage fault.
0xE0100000 - 0xFFFFFFFF Vendor_SYS Partly reserved for future processor feature expansion. Any
attempt to execute instructions from the region results in a
MemManage fault.
The internal Secure Attribution Unit (SAU) determines the security level associated with an address. Some internal
peripherals have memory-mapped registers in the PPB region which are banked between Secure and Non-secure state.
When the processor is in Secure state, software can access both the Secure and Non-secure versions of these
registers. The Non-secure versions are accessed using an aliased address.
For more information about the memory model, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.
3.7.4.3.1. Private Peripheral Bus (PPB)
The Private Peripheral Bus (PPB) memory region provides access to internal and external processor resources.
The internal PPB provides access to:
- The System Control Space (SCS), including the Memory Protection Unit (MPU), Secure Attribution Unit (SAU), and
the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).
- The Data Watchpoint and Trace (DWT) unit.
- The Breakpoint Unit (BPU).
- The Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM).
- CoreSight Micro Trace Buffer (MTB).
- Cross Trigger Interface (CTI).
- The ROM table.
The external PPB (EPPB) provides access to implementation-specific external areas of the PPB memory map.
3.7.4.3.2. Unaligned accesses
The Cortex-M33 processor supports unaligned accesses. They are converted into two or more aligned AHB transactions
on the C-AHB or S-AHB master ports on the processor.
Unaligned support is only available for load/store singles (LDR, LDRH, STR, STRH, TBH) to addresses in Normal
memory. Load/store double and load/store multiple instructions already support word aligned accesses, but do not
permit other unaligned accesses, and generate a fault if this is attempted. Unaligned accesses in Device memory are
not permitted and fault. Unaligned accesses that cross memory map boundaries are architecturally UNPREDICTABLE.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 133

######  NOTE

If CCR.UNALIGN_TRP for the current Security state is set, any unaligned accesses generate a fault.

###### 3.7.4.4. Exclusive monitor

```
The Cortex-M33 processor implements a local exclusive monitor. The local monitor within the processor has been
constructed so that it does not hold any physical address, but instead treats any store-exclusive access as matching the
address of the previous load-exclusive. This means that the implemented exclusives reservation granule is the entire
memory address range. For more information about semaphores and the local exclusive monitor, see the Armv8-M
Architecture Reference Manual.
```
###### 3.7.4.5. Processor core registers summary

The following table shows the processor core register set summary. Each of these registers is 32 bits wide. When the
Armv8-M Security Extension is included, some of the registers are banked. The Secure view of these registers is
available when the Cortex-M33 processor is in Secure state and the Non-secure view when Cortex-M33 processor is in
Non-secure state.
Table 115. Processor
core register set
summary
Name Description
R0-R12 R0-R12 are general-purpose registers for data operations.
MSP (R13) The Stack Pointer (SP) is register R13. In Thread mode, the
CONTROL register indicates the stack pointer to use, Main
Stack Pointer (MSP) or Process Stack Pointer (PSP).
There are two MSP registers in the Cortex-M33 processor:
MSP_NS for the Non-secure state, and MSP_S for the Secure
state.
PSP (R13) The Stack Pointer (SP) is register R13. In Thread mode, the
CONTROL register indicates the stack pointer to use, Main
Stack Pointer (MSP) or Process Stack Pointer (PSP).
There are two PSP registers in the Cortex-M33 processor:
PSP_NS for the Non-secure state, and PSP_S for the Secure
state.
MSPLIM The stack limit registers limit the extent to which the MSP
and PSP registers can descend respectively. There are
two MSPLIM registers in the Cortex-M33 processor:
MSPLIM_NS for the Non-secure state, and MSPLIM_S for the
Secure state.
PSPLIM The stack limit registers limit the extent to which the MSP
and PSP registers can descend respectively. There are
two PSPLIM registers in the Cortex-M33 processor:
PSPLIM_NS for the Non-secure state, and PSPLIM_S for the
Secure state.
LR (R14) The Link Register (LR) is register R14. It stores the return
information for subroutines, function calls, and
exceptions.
PC (R15) The Program Counter (PC) is register R15. It contains the
current program address.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 134

```
Name Description
PSR The Program Status Register (PSR) combines the
Application Program Status Register (APSR), Interrupt
Program Status Register (IPSR), and Execution Program
Status Register (EPSR). These registers provide different
views of the PSR.
PRIMASK The PRIMASK register prevents activation of exceptions with
configurable priority. When the Armv8-M Security
Extension is included, there are two PRIMASK registers in the
Cortex-M33 processor: PRIMASK_NS for the Non-secure state
and PRIMASK_S for the Secure state.
BASEPRI The BASEPRI register defines the minimum priority for
exception processing. There are two BASEPRI registers in
the Cortex-M33 processor: BASEPRI_NS for the Non-secure
state, and BASEPRI_S for the Secure state.
FAULTMASK The FAULTMASK register prevents activation of all exceptions
except for NON-MASKABLE INTERRUPT (NMI) and
Secure HardFault. There are two FAULTMASK registers in the
Cortex-M33 processor: FAULTMASK_NS for the Non-secure
state, and FAULTMASK_S for the Secure state.
CONTROL The CONTROL register controls the stack used, and optionally
the privilege level, when the processor is in Thread mode.
There are two CONTROL registers in the Cortex-M33
processor: CONTROL_NS for the Non-secure state and
CONTROL_S for the Secure state.
```
###### 3.7.4.6. Exceptions

```
Exceptions are handled and prioritized by the processor and the NVIC. In addition to architecturally defined behaviour,
the processor implements advanced exception and interrupt handling that reduces interrupt latency and includes
implementation defined behaviour.
The processor core and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) together prioritize and handle all exceptions.
When handling exceptions:
```
- All exceptions are handled in Handler mode.
- Processor state is automatically stored to the stack on an exception, and automatically restored from the stack at
    the end of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
- The vector is fetched in parallel to the state saving, enabling efficient interrupt entry.
The processor supports tail-chaining that enables back-to-back interrupts without the overhead of state saving and
restoration.
Software can choose only to enable a subset of the configured number of interrupts, and can choose how many bits of
the configured priorities to use.
Exceptions can be specified as either Secure or Non-secure. When an exception occurs the processor switches to the
associated security state. The priority of Secure and Non-secure exceptions can be programmed independently. You
can deprioritise Non-secure configurable exceptions using the AIRCR.PRIS bit field to enable Secure interrupts to take
priority.
When taking and returning from an exception, the register state is always stored using the stack pointer associated with
the background security state. When taking a Non-secure exception from Secure state, all the register state is stacked
and then registers are cleared to prevent Secure data being available to the Non-secure handler. The vector base
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 135

```
address is banked between Secure and Non-secure state. VTOR_S contains the Secure vector base address, and VTOR_NS
contains the Non-secure vector base address. These registers can be programmed by software, and also initialized at
reset by the system.
```
######  NOTE

```
Vector table entries are compatible with interworking between Arm and Thumb instructions. This causes bit[0] of the
vector value to load into the Execution Program Status Register (EPSR) T-bit on exception entry. All populated
vectors in the vector table entries must have bit[0] set. Creating a table entry with bit[0] clear generates an INVSTATE
fault on the first instruction of the handler corresponding to this vector.
```
###### 3.7.4.7. Security attribution and memory protection

```
Security attribution and memory protection in the processor is provided by the Security Attribution Unit (SAU) and the
Memory Protection Units (MPUs).
The SAU is a programmable unit that determines the security of an address. RP2350 includes 8 memory regions.
For instructions and data, the SAU returns the security attribute that is associated with the address.
For instructions, the attribute determines the allowable Security state of the processor when the instruction is executed.
It can also identify whether code at a Secure address can be called from Non-secure state.
For data, the attribute determines whether a memory address can be accessed from Non-secure state, and also whether
the external memory request is marked as Secure or Non-secure.
If a data access is made from Non-secure state to an address marked as Secure, then a SecureFault exception is taken
by the processor. If a data access is made from Secure state to an address marked as Non-secure, then the associated
memory access is marked as Non-secure.
The security level returned by the SAU is a combination of the region type defined in the internal SAU, if configured, and
the type that is returned on the associated Implementation Defined Attribution Unit (IDAU). If an address maps to
regions defined by both internal and external attribution units, the region of the highest security level is selected.
The register fields SAU_CTRL.EN and SAU_CTRL.ALLNS control the enable state of the SAU and the default security level when
the SAU is disabled. Both SAU_CTRL.EN and SAU_CTRL.ALLNS reset to zero disabling the SAU and setting all memory, apart
from some specific regions in the PPB space to Secure level. If the SAU is not enabled, and SAU_CTRL.ALLNS is zero, then
the IDAU cannot set any regions of memory to a security level lower than Secure, for example Secure NSC or NS. If the
SAU is enabled, then SAU_CTRL.ALLNS does not affect the Security level of memory.
RP2350 supports the Armv8-M Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA). The MPU provides full support for:
```
- protection regions
- access permissions
- exporting memory attributes to the system
MPU mismatches and permission violations invoke the MemManage handler. For more information, see the Armv8-M
Architecture Reference Manual.
You can use the MPU to:
- enforce privilege rules
- separate processes
- manage memory attributes
The MPU supports 16 memory regions: 8 secure and 8 non-secure. The MPU is banked between Secure and Non-secure
states. The number of regions in the Secure and Non-secure MPU can be configured independently and each can be
programmed to protect memory for the associated Security state.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 136

###### 3.7.4.8. External coprocessors

The external coprocessor interface:

- Supports low-latency data transfer from the processor to and from the accelerator components.
- Has a sustained bandwidth up to twice of the processor memory interface.
The following instruction types are supported:
- Register transfer from the Cortex-M33 processor to the coprocessor^ MCR,^ MCRR,^ MCR2,^ MCRR2.
- Register transfer from the coprocessor to the Cortex-M33 processor^ MRC,^ MRRC,^ MRC2,^ MRRC2.
- Data processing instructions^ CDP,^ CDP2.

 (^) NOTE
The regular and extension forms of the coprocessor instructions for example, MCR and MCRR2, have the same
functionality but different encodings. The MRC and MRC2 instructions support the transfer of APSR.NZVC flags when the
processor register field is set to PC, for example Rt == 0xF.
3.7.4.8.1. Restrictions
The following restrictions apply when to coprocessor instructions:

- The^ LDC(2)^ or^ STC(2)^ instructions are not supported. If these are included in software with the^ <coproc>^ field set to a
    value between 0-7 and the coprocessor is present and enabled in the appropriate fields in the CPACR/NSACR registers,
    the Cortex-M33 processor always attempts to take an Undefined instruction (UNDEFINSTR) UsageFault exception.
- The processor register fields for data transfer instructions must not include the stack pointer^ (Rt == 0xD), this
    encoding is UNPREDICTABLE in the Armv8-M architecture and results in an Undefined instruction (UNDEFINSTR)
    UsageFault exception in the CPACR/NSACR registers.
- If any coprocessor instruction is executed when the corresponding coprocessor is disabled in the^ CPACR/NSACR
    register, the Cortex-M33 processor always attempts to take a No coprocessor (NOCP) UsageFault exception.
3.7.4.8.2. Data transfer rates
The following table shows the ideal data transfer rates for the coprocessor interface. This means that the coprocessor
responds immediately to an instruction. The ideal data transfer rates are sustainable if the corresponding coprocessor
instructions are executed consecutively.
The following instructions have the following data transfer rates:
MCR, MCR2 (Processor to coprocessor)
32 bits per cycle
MRC, MRC2 (Coprocessor to processor)
32 bits per cycle
MCRR, MCRR2 (Processor to coprocessor)
64 bits per cycle
MRRC, MRRC2 (Coprocessor to processor)
64 bits per cycle

###### 3.7.4.9. Execution timing

This section describes the execution time of various Cortex-M33 instructions. The results are based on measurements
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 137

```
of a limited and non-exceptional set of examples of the more common instructions and hence may not correctly cover
some more unusual situations.
These measurements were taken with the following conditions:
```
- only one core is running
- there are no cache misses (in particular, no XIP cache misses)
- there there is no active DMA
Any of the above conditions can affect the timing of instruction fetch as well as of load and store operations. See the
description of the bus fabric elsewhere in this datasheet for information on possible contention for access to memory.
3.7.4.9.1. Result delays
Some instructions generate results with a two-cycle latency. Using such a result as a source operand for a subsequent
instruction incurs a one-cycle result-use penalty. Most of the input values of any instruction count as source operands,
including:
- any source register in a data processing (ALU) instruction
- any registers used in address generation by an^ LDR^ or^ LDM^ (including^ R13^ in the case of^ POP)
- any registers used in address generation (but not those to be stored) by a^ STR^ or^ STM^ (including^ R13^ in the case of
PUSH).
The following example shows a load followed by a data-processing instruction, an instruction sequence which incurs
this penalty:
LDR R0,[R1]
ADD R1,R0,R2
The following instructions generate results with a two-cycle latency:
- the destination register arising from some non-simple shifts in certain data-processing instructions (specified in
more detail below)
- the destination register or registers of a multiply instruction
- the destination register of an^ LDR
- the^ last^ register in the register list of an^ LDM^ or^ POP^ unless that register is^ R15
Using results of the above instructions as a source operand for another instruction incurs a one-cycle penalty between
the operations.
3.7.4.9.2. Simple arithmetic and logical instructions
Most data processing instructions execute in a single cycle. Some complex operations (including those listed above
and SEL) incur a result-use penalty.
Complex operations meet at least one of the following criteria:
- a shifted operand where the shift is not^ LSL#0,^ LSL#1,^ LSL#2^ or^ LSL#3
- an immediate operand which entails a shift (i.e., not of the form^ 0x000000XY,^ 0xXYXYXYXY,^ 0x00XY00XY^ or^ 0xXY00XY00)
When a complex instruction has the -S suffix to set flags, the one-cycle penalty is always incurred, even if the next
instruction does not depend on those flag values.
The following operations do not incur a penalty:
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 138

```
AND R0,R1,R2,LSL#4
MOV R3,R4
However, the following operations do incur a penalty:
AND R0,R1,R2,LSL#4
MOV R3,R0
ANDS R0,R1,R2,LSL#4
MOV R3,R4
ADD and SUB are available in variants with a 12-bit plain immediate operand. These do not incur a penalty.
MOV and MOVS with an immediate operand, including MOV with a 16-bit plain immediate operand, do not incur a result-use
penalty.
Despite their similarity to logical operations with a shifted operand, UBFX, SBFX and BFI do not incur a result-use penalty.
Simple shift instructions (LSL, LSR, ASR, and ROR, with the shift amount specified either as an immediate constant or in a
register) take one cycle with no result-use penalty.
3.7.4.9.3. Multiply instructions
Multiply and multiply-accumulate instructions execute in a single cycle, but all have a result delay of one cycle.
However, the special case of using the result of a multiply instruction as the accumulate input to a following multiply-
accumulate instruction does not incur a one-cycle penalty. As a result, repeated multiply-accumulate operations can run
at one per cycle, assuming all of the following conditions hold:
```
- the operations accumulate into the same register or register pair
- the multiplier and multiplicand operands come from other registers
Sequences such as the following can execute one instruction per cycle:
MLA R0,R1,R2,R3
MLA R3,R1,R2,R0
MLA R0,R1,R2,R3
MLA R3,R1,R2,R0
...
UMLAL R0,R1,R4,R5
UMLAL R2,R3,R6,R7
UMLAL R0,R1,R4,R5
UMLAL R2,R3,R6,R7
...
The multiplier requires its multiply operands on cycle n, requires its accumulate operand (if any) on cycle n+1, and
makes its result available on cycle n+2.
As a further example, the following sequence completes in 4 cycles:
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 139

ADD R2,R0,R1,LSL#23
MLA R3,R4,R5,R2
MOV R6,R3
The ADD would normally incur a one-cycle result-use penalty, but in this case its result is not needed until the second
cycle of the multiply-accumulate operation, eliminating the penalty.
3.7.4.9.4. Divide instructions
Let n be the difference between the bit positions of the most significant ones in the absolute value of the dividend and
the absolute value of the divisor. If n is negative (in which case the result will be zero), division takes 2 cycles.
Otherwise, division takes 4+n/4 cycles, rounded down.
Using the result of division as input for the next instruction incurs a a one-cycle result-use penalty.
3.7.4.9.5. Register loads (LDR and LDM)
Loads execute in one cycle per register, plus a possible one-cycle result delay. Loads can slow down if the addressed
memory is not able to accept the read request immediately, for example because of contention with instruction
prefetch.
From the point of view of result delays, any register used in address generation counts as a source operand. For
examples, see Table 116.
Table 116. Load
instruction source
operand examples
Instruction Source Operand Not a Source Operand
LDR R0,[R5,R6] R5, R6 R0
LDMIA R7,{R0-R3} R7 R0, R1, R2, R3
There is one cycle of result delay associated with the destination register of an LDR and with the last register in the
register list of an LDM or POP. For example, R7 has one cycle of result delay both in LDR R7,[R5,R6] and in LDMIA R0,{R1-R7}.
The latter case incurs no result delay associated with R1 to R6.
Loading R15 does not cause any result delay; however, extra cycles will be taken as described in Section 3.7.4.9.7.
3.7.4.9.6. Register stores (STR and STM)
Stores, including those which depend on the contents of three different registers such as STR R0,[R1,R2,LSL#2], execute
in one cycle. Like loads, stores can slow down if the addressed memory is not able to accept the request immediately.
The registers involved in address generation, but not the register or registers being stored, count as source operands
from the point of view of result delays. For examples, see Table 117.
Table 117. Register
stores source operand
examples
Instruction Source Operand Not a Source Operand
STR R5,[R6,R7] R6, R7 R5
STMFD R5!,{R0-R3} R5 R0, R1, R2, R3
3.7.4.9.7. Branches
This section covers any instruction that can change R15, including the following:

- MOV R15,Rx
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 140

- BNE
- BL
- BX
- LDR R15,...
- POP {...,R15}
When a branch arises from a load (LDR R15,..., LDMxx Rx,{...,R15}, or POP {...,R15}), the basic time for the instruction is that
taken by the load instruction itself, as described in Section 3.7.4.9.5.
For other instructions that can change R15 (MOV R15,Rx, B<cond>, BL, BX), the basic time for the instruction is zero.
The total time required for a branch that does occur is the basic time + 2 + L + U- ( K & F ) cycles, and the time required for
a branch that does not occur is the basic time + 1 - F cycles, where L, U, F, K are each 0 or 1 as described below:
L
1 when the branch arises from a load (LDR R15,[R6], LDMIA R13,{R0-R3,R15}, and so on); 0 otherwise.
U
1 when the all of following conditions are true:
- the target address of the branch is not word-aligned
- the instruction at that address is 32 bits long
- the instruction executed immediately prior to the branch is not^ POP^ or^ PUSH
If any of the above conditions are not true, U is 0.
F
indicates when the branch can be dual issued (or "folded") with the previous instruction, PrevInst (the instruction
executed immediately prior to the branch). F is 1 when all of the following conditions are true:
- the branch instruction is^ B,^ B<cond>, or^ BX R14^ (but not^ BX^ to any other register or^ MOV R15,R14)
- PrevInst^ is 16 bits long
- PrevInst^ was executed sequentially (i.e., not itself branched to), or^ PrevInst^ is word-aligned
- PrevInst^ itself was not itself folded with a previous instruction
If any of the above conditions are not true, F is 0.
K
1 when it is known that the branch will execute prior to executing PrevInst; 0 otherwise. In other words, K is 1 unless
the branch is conditional and PrevInst sets the flags.
For example, the following delay loop takes 299 cycles:
10000002: MOVS R5,#100
10000004: SUBS R5,R5,#1
10000006: BNE 0x10000004
Those cycles come from the following timings:
- 1 cycle for^ MOVS R5,#100
- 1 cycle for each^ SUBS R5,R5,#1
- 2 cycles each for the first 99^ BNE^ instructions (L=U=0,^ F=1,^ K=0)
- 0 cycles for the last, non-taken,^ BNE^ (L=U=0,^ F=1,^ K=0, using the formula 1-F)
At a different alignment, the same delay loop takes 300 cycles:
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 141

```
10000000: MOVS R5,#100
10000002: SUBS R5,R5,#1
10000004: BNE 0x10000002
Those cycles come from the following timings:
```
- 1 cycle for^ MOVS R5,#100;
- 1 cycle for each^ SUBS R5,R5,#1;
- 2 cycles for the first^ BNE^ (L=U=0,^ F=1,^ K=0);
- 2 cycles each for the next 98^ BNE^ instructions (L=U=0,^ F=K=0);
- 1 cycle for the last, non-taken,^ BNE^ (L=U=0,^ F=K=0, using the formula 1-F).
This longer delay loop also takes 300 cycles:
10000000: MOVS R5,#100
10000002: SUBS R5,R5,#1
10000004: MOV R1,R2
10000006: BNE 0x10000002
Those cycles come from the following timings:
- 1 cycle for^ MOVS R5,#100;
- 1 cycle for each^ SUBS R5,R5,#1;
- 1 cycle for each^ MOV R1,R2;
- 1 cycle each for the first 99^ BNE^ instructions (L=U=0,^ F=K=1);
- 0 cycles for the last, non-taken,^ BNE^ (L=U=0,^ F=K=1; using the formula 1-F).
This example illustrates that, if you can contrive to place an instruction between the loop-end test and the branch, it can
potentially have zero net cost in execution time.
Another optimisation is to try to ensure that a branch target is either word-aligned or is a 16-bit instruction. Any
instruction following a BL can be considered a branch target from this point of view as it is branched to by the return
instruction from the subroutine.
If space and cache permit, unrolling loops and inlining subroutines avoids the branch cost altogether.
A sequence of branches not taken will alternately take 0 cycles and 1 cycle. That is the same as a sequence of NOP
instructions, which can also be folded. However, this is not the same as sequence of instructions in an IT block that fail
their condition.
3.7.4.9.8. IT (if-then) blocks
Instructions within an IT block whose condition fails execute in one cycle.
Most instructions within an IT block whose condition succeeds take the number of cycles they would have taken in their
normal, unconditional state.
3.7.4.9.9. Dual issue
When a 16-bit instruction follows a NOP instruction (opcode 0xBF00, not 0x46C0), the instructions are folded, executing the
NOP in zero cycles. In some situations, this can help align a branch target to a word-aligned address without an
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 142

```
execution-time penalty.
When a 16-bit opcode follows an IT instruction, the IT instruction executes in zero cycles.
The Cortex-M33 core folds a NOP with the previous instruction (PrevInst) if all of the following conditions are true:
```
- PrevInst^ is 16 bits long
- PrevInst^ was executed sequentially (not itself branched to)^ or^ PrevInst^ is word-aligned
- PrevInst^ was not itself folded with a previous instruction
Branches not taken are in this sense similar to NOP instructions: they can be folded according to the same rule. For
further detail on when taken and not taken branches are folded, see Section 3.7.4.9.7.
When two multi-cycle instructions are folded, at most one cycle can overlap between the instructions.
3.7.4.9.10. Floating-point coprocessor operations
This section describes operations involving the single-precision floating-point coprocessor (FPU). For timings relating to
the GPIO coprocessor, the double-precision coprocessor, and the redundancy coprocessor, see Section 3.7.4.9.11 and
the detailed descriptions of those coprocessors elsewhere in this document.
Issuing a floating-point instruction occupies the integer core for one cycle. After that, the integer core can proceed with
other non-FPU operations without interruption.
Attempting to issue another FPU instruction stalls execution until the FPU is ready to accept the FPU instruction.
The following list details the timings of various FPU instructions:
- VADD.F32,^ VSUB.F32^ and^ VMUL.F32^ can execute in one cycle, but have an additional cycle of result delay. As a result, the
following example sequence executes at two cycles per instruction:
VADD.F32 s0,s0,s2
VADD.F32 s0,s0,s3
VADD.F32 s0,s0,s4
VADD.F32 s0,s0,s5
...
The following interleaved example, however, executes at one cycle per instruction:
VADD.F32 s0,s0,s2
VADD.F32 s1,s1,s3
VADD.F32 s0,s0,s4
VADD.F32 s1,s1,s5
...
Furthermore, you can interleave VADD.F32, VSUB.F32 and VMUL.F32 instructions arbitrarily to execute in one cycle, as
long as no instruction depends on the result of its predecessor.
- VMLA.F32^ and^ VFMA.F32^ occupy the FPU for 3 cycles, plus one cycle of result delay.
However, consecutive VMLA.F32 or VFMA.F32 instructions accumulating into the same register can run at one
instruction every three cycles.
- When the work can be interleaved, separate^ VMUL.F32^ and^ VADD.F32^ instructions are faster than a single^ VMLA.F32
instruction.
- VDIV.F32^ and^ VSQRT.F32^ occupy the FPU for 14 cycles, plus one cycle of result delay.
- VMOV.F32 Sx,Ry^ (move one word from integer register to coprocessor) takes one cycle.
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 143

- VMOV.F32 Rx,Sy^ (move one word from coprocessor to integer register) takes one cycle plus one cycle of result delay.
- VMOV.F32 Sx,Sy^ (move one word between coprocessor registers) takes one cycle.
- VMOV.F64 Dx,Ry,Rz^ (move two words from integer registers to coprocessor) occupies the FPU for two cycles and the
    integer core for one cycle.
- VMOV.F64 Rx,Ry,Dz^ (move two words from coprocessor to integer registers) occupies both the FPU and the integer
    core for two cycles.
3.7.4.9.11. Other coprocessor operations
A coprocessor can stall an operation if it is not ready. For more information, see the documentation for the specific
coprocessor.
The following list details the timings of various coprocessor instructions:
- Assuming that no stalls occur, a^ CDP^ instruction takes one cycle.
- An^ MCR^ instruction (move one word from integer register to coprocessor) takes one cycle.
- An^ MRC^ instruction (move one word from coprocessor to integer register) takes one cycle, plus one cycle of result
delay.
- An^ MCRR^ instruction (move two words from integer registers to coprocessor) takes one cycle.
- An^ MRRC^ instruction (move two words from coprocessor to integer registers) takes one cycle, plus one cycle of
result delay.
3.7.4.9.12. Instruction fetch
Each Cortex-M33 core has separate instruction and data buses ("Harvard architecture"). Each core has a bandwidth to
memory of 32 bits per cycle. Since each instruction is at most 32 bits long, for sequential code the instruction
prefetcher has enough bandwidth to ensure that the processor core always has instructions.
In RP2350, contention can occur when the instruction and data buses attempt to access data stored in memory
connected to the same downstream port of the AHB5 crossbar. For example, code running from the main SRAM might
attempt to load a literal stored nearby. That load might conflict with an instruction prefetch to the same SRAM. To
reduce the chance of this conflict, the main SRAM is striped into banks across groups of four words: words at
addresses that are different modulo 16 are stored in different banks.
Since the prefetcher typically runs about two words (8 bytes) ahead of execution, that means that an instruction that
reads 8 (modulo 16) bytes ahead of itself is liable to result in a conflict. For example, the following instruction, which
reads 40 bytes ahead (because here PC means the address of the next instruction), can sometimes incur a penalty of
one cycle:
LDR R8,[PC,#32] @ 32-bit instruction

###### 3.7.4.10. Debug

```
Cortex-M33 debug functionality includes processor halt, single-step, processor core register access, Vector Catch,
unlimited software breakpoints, and full system memory access.
The processor also includes support for hardware breakpoints and watchpoints configured during implementation:
```
- A breakpoint unit supporting eight instruction comparators
- A watchpoint unit supporting four data watchpoint comparators
The Cortex-M33 processor supports system level debug authentication to control access from a debugger to resources
3.7. Cortex-M33 processor 144

```
and memory. Authentication via the Armv8-M Security Extension can be used to allow a debugger full access to Non-
secure code and data without exposing any Secure information.
The processor implementation can be partitioned to place the debug components in a separate power domain from the
processor core and NVIC.
All debug registers are accessible by the D-AHB interface.
For more information, see the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.
```
###### 3.7.4.11. Data Watchpoint and Trace unit (DWT)

```
The DWT is a full configuration, containing four comparators (DWT_COMP0 to DWT_COMP3). These comparators support the
following features:
```
- Hardware watchpoint support
- Hardware trace packet support
- CMPMATCH support for ETM/MTB/CTI triggers
- Cycle counter matching support (DWT_COMP0 only)
- Instruction address matching support
- Data address matching support
- Data value matching support (DWT_COMP1 only in a reduced DWT, DWT_COMP3 only in a Full DWT)
- Linked/limit matching support (DWT_COMP1 and DWT_COMP3 only)
The DWT contains counters for:
- Cycles (DWT_CYCCNT.CYCCNT)
- Folded Instructions (FOLDCNT)
- Additional cycles required to execute all load/store instructions (LSUCNT)
- Processor sleep cycles (SLEEPCNT)
- Additional cycles required to execute multi-cycle instructions and instruction fetch stalls (CPICNT)
- Cycles spent in exception processing (EXCCNT)
Before using DWT, set the DEMCR.TRCENA bit to 1.
The DWT provides periodic requests for protocol synchronization to the ITM and the TPIU.

###### 3.7.4.12. Cross Trigger Interface (CTI)

The CTI enables the debug logic, MTB, and ETM to interact with each other and with other CoreSight components. This
is called cross triggering. For example, you can configure the CTI to generate an interrupt when the ETM trigger event
occurs or to start tracing when a DWT comparator match is detected.
The following figure shows the debug system components and the available trigger inputs and trigger outputs:
Figure 15 shows the components of the debug system.

After the processor is halted using CTI Trigger Output 0, the Processor Debug Request signal remains asserted. The
debugger must write to CTIINTACK to clear the halting request before restarting the processor.
After asserting an interrupt using the CTI Trigger Output 1 or 2, the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) must clear the
interrupt request by writing to the CTI Interrupt Acknowledge, CTIINTACK.
Interrupt requests from the CTI to the system are only asserted when invasive debug is enabled in the processor.

## 3.8. Hazard3 processor

```
Hazard3 is a low-area, high-performance RISC-V processor with a 3-stage in-order pipeline. RP2350 configures the
following standard RISC-V extensions:
```
- RV32I: 32-bit base instruction set
- M: Integer multiply/divide/modulo instructions
- A: Atomic memory operations
- C: Compressed 16-bit instructions (equivalently spelled^ Zca)
- Zba: Address generation instructions
- Zbb: Basic bit manipulation instructions
- Zbs: Single-bit manipulation instructions
- Zbkb: Basic bit manipulation for scalar cryptography
- Zcb: Basic additional compressed instructions
- Zcmp: Push/pop and double-move compressed instructions
- Zicsr: CSR access instructions
- Debug, Machine and User execution modes
- Physical Memory Protection unit (PMP) with eight regions, 32-byte granule, NAPOT
- External debug support with four instruction address triggers
Additionally, RP2350 enables the following Hazard3 custom extensions:
- Xh3power: Power management instructions and CSRs
- Xh3bextm: Bit-extract-multiple instruction (used in bootrom)
- Xh3irq: Local interrupt controller with nested, prioritised IRQ support
- Xh3pmpm: Unlocked M-mode PMP regions
Hazard3 Source Code
All hardware source files for Hazard3 are available under Apache 2.0 licensing at:

#### 3.8.1. Instruction set reference

```
This section is a programmer’s reference guide for the instructions supported by Hazard3. It covers basic assembly
syntax, instruction behaviour, ranges for immediate values, and conditions for instruction compression. The index lists
instructions alphabetically, including pseudo-instructions.
The pseudocode in this guide is informative only, and is no replacement for the official RISC-V specifications in Section
3.8.1.1. However, it should prove a useful mnemonic aid once you have read the specifications.
```
###### 3.8.1.1. Links to RISC-V specifications

```
###### 3.8.1.2. Architecture strings

```
-march strings completely specify the set of available RISC-V instructions, so that a compiler can generate correct and
optimal code for your device. Use the following in descending order of preference:
```
1. Use rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb_zcmp for compilers which support the Zcb and Zcmp extensions,
    such as GCC 14.
2. Use rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb for GCC 14 packaged with an older assembler which does not
    support Zcmp.
3. Use rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb for older compilers, such as GCC 13 and below.

###### 3.8.1.3. RISC-V architectural state

The mutable state visible to the programmer consists of:

- The 31^ ×^ 32-bit integer general-purpose registers (GPRs), named^ x1^ through^ x31
- The program counter^ pc, which points to the beginning of the current instruction in memory
- The control and status registers (CSRs), which configure processor behaviour and are used in trap handling
- The local monitor bit, which helps maintain correctness of atomic read-modify-write sequences
- The current privilege level, which determines which memory locations the core can access, which CSRs it can
    access, and which instructions it can execute
Hazard3 supports two privilege levels: Machine and User. These are interchangeably referred to as modes, and are
commonly abbreviated as M-mode and U-mode. Debug mode behaves as an additional privilege level above M-mode.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 234

```
The 0th general-purpose register, x0, is hardwired to zero and ignores writes.
There is no flags register; branch instructions perform GPR-to-GPR comparisons directly.
This state is duplicated per hardware thread, or hart. RP2350 implements two Hazard3 cores, each with one hart.
3.8.1.3.1. Register conventions
The following ABI names are synonymous with x0 through x31:
Register ABI Name Description
x0 zero Hardwired to zero; ignores writes
x1 ra Return address (link register)
x2 sp Stack pointer
x3 gp Global pointer
x4 tp Thread pointer
x5 - x7 t0 - t2 Temporaries
x8 s0 or fp Saved register or frame pointer
x9 s1 Saved register
x10 - x11 a0 - a1 Function arguments and return values
x12 - x17 a2 - a7 Function arguments
x18 - x27 s2 - s11 Saved registers
x28 - x31 t3 - t6 Temporaries
Registers x1 through x31 are identical, and any 32-bit opcode can use any combination of these registers. However,
compressed instructions give preferential treatment to commonly-used registers sp, ra, s0, s1, and a0 through a5 to
improve code density. All compressed instructions implemented by Hazard3 are 16-bit aliases for existing 32-bit
instructions, so you can still perform any operation on any register.
See the RISC-V PSABI Specification for more information on the ABI register assignment as well as the RISC-V
procedure calling convention.
```
###### 3.8.1.4. Compressed instructions

```
The RISC-V extensions which Hazard3 implements use a mixture of 32-bit and 16-bit opcodes, the latter being referred
to as compressed instructions. With the exception of Zcmp, each compressed instruction maps to a subset of an existing
32-bit instruction. For example, c.add is a 16-bit alias of the add instruction, with restrictions on register allocation.
The assembler automatically uses compressed instructions when possible. For example, add a0, a0, a1 is a
compressible form of add. This assembles to the 16-bit opcode c.add a0, a1 when compressed instructions are enabled
in the assembler.
The following extensions use 16-bit opcodes:
```
- C: compressed instructions (the non-floating-point subset is equivalently spelled as^ Zca)
- Zcb: additional basic compressed instructions
- Zcmp: compressed push, pop and double-move
Disabling the above extensions for compilation (and assembly) aligns all instructions to 32-bit boundaries. This may
have a minor performance advantage for branch-dense code sequences (see Section 3.8.7), at the cost of poorer code
density.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 235

```
When an instruction has an optional 16-bit compressed form, the limitations of the compressed form are documented
in the listing for the 32-bit form. It is useful to be aware of these restrictions when optimising for code size. If no such
limitations are mentioned, it means the instruction is always a 32-bit opcode.
Zcmp is an outlier in that its instructions each expand to a sequence of 32-bit instructions from the RV32I base instruction
set. They therefore have no direct 32-bit counterparts.
```
###### 3.8.1.5. Conventions for pseudocode

Pseudocode in this section is in Verilog 2005 syntax (IEEE 1364-2005). These Verilog operators are used throughout:

- Infix operators^ +,^ - ,^ *,^ /,^ &,^ ^,^ |,^ <<,^ ==,^ !=,^ <^ and^ >=^ can be considered the same as the corresponding C operator.
- $signed()^ bit-casts to a signed value; comparisons between two signed values are signed comparisons.
- >>^ is always a logical (zero-extending) right shift.
- >>>^ on a signed value is an arithmetic (sign-extending) right shift.
- {a, b}^ is the bit-concatenation of^ a^ and^ b, with^ a^ in the more-significant position of the result.
- a[n]^ on an array is a subscript array access. For example^ mem[0]^ is the first byte of memory.
- x[m:l]^ on a packed array (a bit vector) is a bit slice of^ x, where^ m^ is the (inclusive) MSB and^ l^ is the (inclusive) LSB.
    For example rs1[7:0] is the 8 least-significant bits of rs1.
- {n{x}}, where^ n^ is a constant and^ x^ is a packed array, replicates^ x^ n^ times.^ n^ copies of^ x^ are concatenated together.
    For example {32{1’b1}} is a 32-bit all-ones value.
The pseudocode uses <= non-blocking assignments to assign to outputs: all such assignments are applied in a batch
after the block of pseudocode has executed. Local variables may be assigned with = blocking assignments, which
update the assignee immediately, similar to = procedural assignments in e.g. C programs. This distinction is important
in some cases where e.g. rd and rs1 may alias the same register, but it’s generally sufficient just to be aware that a <= b
and a = b are both assignments into a.
3.8.1.5.1. Variables used in pseudocode
Pseudocode in this guide uses the following conventions for variables:
- rs1,^ rs2, and^ rd^ are 32-bit unsigned packed arrays (bit vectors), representing the values of the two register operands
and the destination register.
- regnum_rs1,^ regnum_rs2, and^ regnum_rd^ are the 5-bit register numbers which select a GPR for^ rs1,^ rs2, and^ rd
- imm^ is a 32-bit unsigned packed array referring to the instruction’s immediate value.
- pc^ is a 32-bit unsigned packed array referring to the program counter, which is exactly the address of the current
instruction.
- mem^ is an array of 8-bit unsigned packed arrays, each corresponding to a byte address in memory.
- csr^ is an array of 32-bit unsigned packed arrays, each corresponding to a CSR listed in Section 3.8.9.
- priv^ is a 2-bit unsigned packed array which contains the value^ 0x3^ when the core is in Debug or M-mode, and^ 0x0
when the core is in U-mode.
- i^ and^ j^ are pseudocode temporary variables of type^ integer^ which may be used for loop variables.
The following tasks are used throughout:
- raise_exception(n)^ raises an exception with a cause of^ n^ (see Section 3.8.4.1).
- bus_error(addr)^ returns^1 when the address^ addr^ returns a bus error, and^0 otherwise.

```
These instructions calculate a function of one register rs1 and one immediate operand imm. They write the 32-bit result

seqz rd, rs1 // pseudo: imm is 1
Operation:
rd <= rs1 < imm;
Immediate range: -0x800 through 0x7ff
Note the negative values indicated for the immediate range are two’s complement: this instruction uses them in an
unsigned context, so -0x800 through -0x001 can be thought of as +0xfffff800 through +0xffffffff for the comparison.
srai
Shift right, arithmetic, immediate.
Usage:
srai rd, rs1, imm
Operation:
rd <= $signed(rs1) >>> imm;
Immediate range: 0 through 31.

Immediate range: -0x80000 through 0x7ffff if 32-bit, or -0x20 through 0x1f if 16-bit.
Compressible if: rd is neither zero nor sp, and imm is nonzero in the range -0x20 through 0x1f.

rd <= pc + 4; // or +2 if opcode is 16-bit
pc <= label;
Immediate range: even values in the range -0x100000 through 0x0ffffe (±1 MB) if 32-bit, or -0x800 through 0x7fe
(±2 kB) if 16-bit.
Compressible if: rd is zero or ra, and immediate is in the range -0x800 through 0x7fe.
jalr
Jump and link, register-offset.

Compressible if: rd is zero or ra, immediate is zero, and rs1 is not zero.
```
###### 3.8.1.11. RV32I: base ISA (load and store)

These instructions transfer data between memory and core registers. The register operand rs1 and immediate imm are
added to form the address. Stores write register operand rs2 into memory, and loads read from memory into the
destination register rd.
All load and store instructions to naturally aligned addresses on RISC-V are single-copy atomic. This means a naturally-
aligned load does not observe byte tearing between the values that a memory location held before and after any
naturally-aligned store to that location. Equivalently, all bytes covered by a single naturally-aligned load or store
instruction transfer in a single transaction with the memory subsystem.
Hazard3 raises an exception on a load or store to a non-naturally-aligned address. See Section 3.8.4.1 for an exhaustive
list of exception causes.

###### 3.8.1.13. A: Atomics

These instructions help software to safely and concurrently modify shared variables. They fall into two groups:
3.8. Hazard3 processor 254

- lr.w^ and^ sc.w, load-reserved and store-conditional instructions, which allow software to safely perform read-modify-
    write operations on shared variables by looping until success
- amo*.w^ instructions (atomic memory operations or AMOs), which atomically modify a memory location and return
    the value it held immediately prior to modification
The pseudocode in this section references the 1-bit global variable local_monitor_valid. It is true when the hart has:
- previously completed a successful AHB5 exclusive read
- not attempted an exclusive write since the read
- not been interrupted or taken an exception since the read (implementation-defined behaviour)
The pseudocode maintains this invariant over the local_monitor_valid flag. This flag helps the hart maintain atomicity of
its read-modify-write sequences with respect to its own interrupts. Hardware refuses to perform exclusive writes when
the local monitor flag is not set.
AMOs clear the local monitor state even when bailing out during the read phase, since even in this case you have
attempted to execute an instruction which performs an exclusive write. In an lr.w, sc.w sequence with an AMO executed
in between, the sc.w always fails.
Hazard3 builds its atomic shared memory implementation on top of AHB5 exclusive accesses. The following tasks,
used throughout this section, represent AHB5 32-bit exclusive reads and writes:
// Read 32 bits from memory and return reservation success/fail according to
// global monitor. Set local monitor bit if the reservation succeeded.
task exclusive_read_32;
input [31:0] addr;
output [31:0] data;
output exclusive_ok;
begin
data = {
mem[addr + 3],
mem[addr + 2],
mem[addr + 1],
mem[addr]
};
local_monitor_valid = global_monitor_read(addr);
exclusive_ok = local_monitor_valid;
end
endtask
// Attempt to write 32 bits to memory, and return write success/fail according
// to global monitor. Always clear the local monitor flag.
task exclusive_write_32;
input [31:0] addr;
input [31:0] data;
output exclusive_ok;
begin
if (!local_monitor_valid) begin
exclusive_ok = 0; // Write refused by local monitor
end else if (global_monitor_write(addr)) begin
exclusive_ok = 1; // Write succeeds
mem[addr + 3] <= data[31:24];
mem[addr + 2] <= data[23:16];
mem[addr + 1] <= data[15: 8];
mem[addr + 0] <= data[ 7: 0];
end else begin
exclusive_ok = 0; // Write refused by global monitor
end
local_monitor_valid = 0; // Always clear local monitor
end
3.8. Hazard3 processor 255

endtask
The functions global_monitor_read(addr); and global_monitor_write(addr); in the above code return the global monitor
response for an exclusive read or write to this address, following the rules laid out in Section 2.1.6. The global monitor
enforces atomicity of this hart’s read-modify-write sequences with respect to other harts sharing the same memory.
Because Hazard3 implements an AMO as a hardware-sequenced read-modify-write retry loop using AHB5 exclusives,
the hardware promotes a read reservation failure during an AMO to a store/AMO fault exception (mcause = 7 ). This
behaviour avoids an infinite loop when accessing locations which do not support exclusive access.

###### 3.8.1.14. C: Compressed instructions

All instructions in the C extension are 16-bit aliases of 32-bit instructions from other extensions. In the case of Hazard3,
which lacks the F extension, these are all aliases of base I instructions. They behave identically to their 32-bit
counterparts.
C adds compressed aliases for the following instructions from RV32I:
Alphabetical order: left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
add addi and andi beq bne
ebreak jal jalr lui lw or
slli srai srli sub sw xor
See the per-instruction documentation for the compression limitations of each instruction. The assembler automatically
uses compressed variants when the limitations are met, and when the relevant compressed instruction extension is
enabled for the assembler, for example by passing c in the -march ISA string.
The above also applies to Zca and Zcb: the former is an alias for the non-floating-point subset of C, and the latter adds 16-
bit aliases for additional common instructions from the I, M and Zbb extensions. Each Zcmp instruction expands to a
sequence of multiple instructions from the I extension.

```
Zcmp adds 16-bit instructions which expand to common sequences of 32-bit RV32I instructions used in function
prologues and epilogues. The following is a rough description of the available instructions:
```
- cm.push: allocates a stack frame and saves registers.

### ◦ Push^ ra^ onto the stack.

### ◦ Optionally push a number of the^ s0^ through^ s11^ saved registers, consecutively up from^ s0.

### ◦ Round the total stack decrement to a multiple of 16 bytes, to maintain stack alignment if already aligned.

### ◦ Decrement the stack pointer by up to 48 additional bytes, in multiples of 16 bytes, to allocate additional frame

space.

### ◦ There are twelve^ s*^ registers, and you can push any number of them^ except for eleven.^ If you need to push

more than ten s* registers, push twelve.

- cm.pop: reverse of^ cm.push. Deallocates a stack frame and restores^ ra, optionally^ s0^ through^ s11.
- cm.popret: equivalent to^ cm.pop^ followed by^ ret. Deallocates a stack frame, restores saved registers, and returns.
- cm.popretz: equivalent to^ cm.pop; li a0, 0; ret. It is common for functions to return a constant^0.
- cm.mvsa01: move^ a0^ and^ a1^ into any two registers in the range^ s0^ through^ s7. Used to save arguments over embedded
    calls.
- cm.mva01s: move into^ a0^ and^ a1, from any two registers in^ s0^ through^ s7. Used to restore saved arguments.

respect to interrupts. See Section 3.8.7 for cycle counts for these instructions on Hazard3.

###### 3.8.1.21. RV32I and Zifencei: Memory ordering instructions

These instructions control observed memory ordering of loads and stores in multi-hart systems. They also enforce
when a hart’s instruction fetch observes its own stores.
fence
Constrain the position of this hart’s accesses in the total memory order, according to this hart’s program order.
Usage:
// <set> is a nonempty string which matches the regex i?o?r?w?
fence <set>, <set> // predecessor, successor
fence // pseudo: fence iorw, iorw
fence.tso // variant of fence rw, rw; see below
Operation: Hazard3 has no store buffer, and assumes the memory subsystem is sequentially consistent. Therefore
no additional book-keeping is required to enforce ordering on shared memory, and this instruction executes as a no-
op. (The SDK still uses fence instructions, and the ordered variants of amo*.w, for portability across platforms which
3.8. Hazard3 processor 273

```
take advantage of relaxed memory ordering.)
Nominally a fence enforces that the predecessor set appears before the successor set in the total memory order.
These sets respectively contain the hart’s memory accesses before and after the fence instruction in program order,
and are further filtered by a 4-bit mask each:
```
- Device input (I)
- Device output (O)
- Read (R)
- Write (W)
The fence.tso (total store order) variant is equivalent to fence rw, rw except that it does not enforce write-before-
read ordering.
fence.i
Instruction fence. Ensure subsequent instruction fetches on this hart observe this hart’s previous stores.
Usage:
fence.i
Operation:
1. Clear the branch target buffer (Section 3.8.7.10)
2. Jump to the instruction at the sequentially-next address (pc + 4 ), to clear the prefetch buffer.
The prefetch buffer can reorder instruction fetch against stores which are earlier in program order. For example:
la a0, label // get address for store instruction
li a1, 0x9002 // get immediate value of c.ebreak
div t1, t1, t1 // long-running instruction, fills prefetch buffer
sh a1, (a0) // write to next address. (16-bit opcode)
label:
nop // (16-bit opcode)
If you execute the above code on Hazard3, you may or may not get a breakpoint exception at label. The outcome
depends on how many cycles the bus accesses take. This is permitted by the RISC-V memory model.
This case is generally only reachable on fall-through, because Hazard3 does not prefetch through control flow
instructions except for the taken backward conditional branch currently allocated in the branch target buffer. In
particular it does not prefetch through indirect branches like ret. You are unlikely to hit this issue in practice;
however, be aware fence.i is the standard mechanism for solving this class of problem.
Hazard3 behaves unpredictably if you write to the address of a conditional branch instruction that is currently
tagged in the branch target buffer, and then execute that conditional branch instruction without first executing a
fence.i. Avoid this by always executing a fence.i between writing to memory and executing that same memory.

###### 3.8.1.22. Zicsr: Control and status register access

These instructions access the control and status registers (CSRs) listed in Section 3.8.9. A CSR instruction may read a
CSR, modify a CSR, or simultaneously read and modify the same CSR. A modification consists of a normal write, an
atomic bit-clear, or an atomic bit-set.
CSR addresses are in the range 0x000 through 0xfff (12 bits, 4096 possible CSRs). The CSR address is an immediate
constant in the instruction, so you cannot index CSRs with runtime values. The assembler accepts numeric constants or
3.8. Hazard3 processor 274

CSR names such as mstatus as CSR addresses.
csrrc
Simultaneously read and clear bits in a CSR.
Usage:
csrrc rd, <addr>, rs1
csrc <addr>, rs1 // pseudo: rd is zero
Operation:
rd <= csr[addr];
if (regnum_rs1 != 5'h00)
csr[addr] <= csr[addr] & ~rs1;
csrrci
Simultaneously read and clear bits in a CSR, with an immediate value for the clear.
Usage:
csrrci rd, <addr>, imm
csrci <addr>, imm // pseudo: rd is zero
Operation:
rd <= csr[addr];
if (imm != 32'h0)
csr[addr] <= csr[addr] & ~imm;
Immediate range: 0 through 31.
csrrs
Simultaneously read and set bits in a CSR.
Usage:
csrrs rd, <addr>, rs1
csrs <addr>, rs1 // pseudo: rd is zero
csrr rd, <addr> // pseudo: rs1 is zero
Operation:
rd <= csr[addr];
if (regnum_rs1 != 5'h00)
csr[addr] <= csr[addr] | rs1;
3.8. Hazard3 processor 275

csrrsi
Simultaneously read and set bits in a CSR, with an immediate value for the set.
Usage:

csrsi <addr>, imm // pseudo: rd is zero
Operation:
rd <= csr[addr];
if (imm != 32'h0)
csr[addr] <= csr[addr] | imm;
Immediate range: 0 through 31.
csrrw
Simultaneously read and write a CSR.
Usage:
csrrw rd, <addr>, rs1
csrw <addr>, rs1 // pseudo: rd is zero
Operation:
if (regnum_rd != 5'h00)
rd <= csr[addr];
csr[addr] <= rs1;
csrrwi
Simultaneously read and write a CSR, with an immediate value for the write.
Usage:
csrrwi rd, <addr>, imm
csrwi <addr>, imm // pseudo: rd is zero

Immediate range: 0 through 31.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 276

###### 3.8.1.23. Privileged instructions

These instructions are part of the trap and interrupt control support defined in the privileged ISA manual. The other part
of this support is the CSRs (Section 3.8.9).
ebreak
Raise a breakpoint exception.
Usage:
ebreak
Operation:
raise_exception(4'h3); // Cause = ebreak
Compressible if: always.
Privilege requirements: any privilege level.
See Section 3.8.4 for details of the RISC-V trap entry sequence. All exceptions trap into M-mode on Hazard3. The
exception program counter mepc points to the start of the ebreak instruction.
An external debug host can catch the execution of breakpoint instructions. If the core is in M-mode, and
DCSR.EBREAKM is set, the core enters Debug mode instead of taking the exception. In U-mode, DCSR.EBREAKU
enables the same behaviour.
ecall
Environment call. Raise an exception to access a handler at a higher privilege level.
Usage:
ecall
Operation:
if (priv == 2'h3)
raise_exception(4'hb); // Cause: Environment call from M-mode
else
raise_exception(4'h8); // Cause: Environment call from U-mode
Privilege requirements: any privilege level.
See Section 3.8.4 for details of the RISC-V trap entry sequence. All exceptions trap into M-mode on Hazard3. The
exception program counter mepc points to the start of the ecall instruction.
mret
Return from M-mode trap.
Usage:
mret
3.8. Hazard3 processor 277

```
Operation: execute the trap return sequence described in Section 3.8.4.
Privilege requirements: M-mode only.
wfi
Wait for interrupt.
Usage:
wfi
Operation: pause execution until the processor is interrupted, or enters Debug mode.
Privilege requirements: M-mode is always permitted. U-mode is permitted if MSTATUS.TW is clear.
wfi ignores the global interrupt enable, MSTATUS.MIE. It respects all other interrupt controls. For example:
```
- If MIP.MEIP is^1 , MIE.MEIE is^1 , and MSTATUS.MIE is^0 , a^ wfi^ instruction falls through immediately without
    pausing.
- In this example, setting MSTATUS.MIE to^1 would cause the core to immediately take the interrupt.
- If no bit is set in both MIP and MIE, the^ wfi^ stalls until there is at least one such bit.
When a wfi is interrupted, the exception return address MEPC points to the instruction following the wfi.
When the debugger halts the core during a wfi, DPC points to the instruction immediately following the wfi
instruction. wfi executes as a no-op under instruction single-stepping (it does not stall), and under Debug-mode
execution in the Program Buffer.
Hazard3’s MSLEEP CSR controls additional power-saving measures the core can implement during a wfi sleep
state.

#### 3.8.2. Memory access

```
Hazard3 accesses memory within a 4 GB (2^32 bytes) physical address space. There is no address translation. Each
possible value of an integer register uniquely identifies a single byte in the physical address space. Multi-byte values
occupy consecutive byte addresses.
```
###### 3.8.2.1. Endianness

Hazard3 is always little-endian for all load and store accesses. RISC-V instruction fetch is always little-endian.
This means in a multi-byte access such as a sw instruction (four bytes are transferred), data stored at higher byte
addresses has greater numerical significance. For example:
li a0, 0x0d0c0b0a // materialise constant in register
la a4, some_global_variable // materialise address (assume addr % 4 == 0)
sw a0, (a4) // 4-byte write to memory
lbu a0, 0(a4) // load byte from addr + 0: 0x0a
lbu a1, 1(a4) // load byte from addr + 1: 0x0b
lbu a2, 2(a4) // load byte from addr + 2: 0x0c
lbu a3, 3(a4) // load byte from addr + 3: 0x0d

###### 3.8.2.2. Physical memory attributes

The RP2350 address space has the following physical memory attributes:

Non-idempotent
All addresses have Strong ordering. Any address not listed in Table 366 is a Vacant address. Accessing these
addresses has no effect other than returning a bus fault.
Hazard3’s PMP implementation requires that non-read-idempotent PMAs are also non-executable, because it enforces
execute permissions at the point an instruction is executed, rather than the point an instruction is fetched. Therefore all
non-idempotent locations in Table 366 are also non-executable. This is enforced at a lower level than the PMP, and
executing these addresses at any privilege level will always fault.
Cached XIP regions are not cacheable from a PMA point of view, because the cache is private to the memory controller.
Each system address is served by either a single cache controller or none, so coherence between harts is irrelevant. You
might have to perform manual cache maintenance following some operations like flash programming, but this is a
detail of the XIP subsystem, not the system-level memory model.
For definitions of these attributes, see section 3.6 of the RISC-V privileged ISA manual linked in Section 3.8.1.1.

#### 3.8.3. Memory protection

Hazard3 implements Physical Memory Protection (PMP). It does not implement the Sv32 virtual memory extension or
its associated protections.
The PMP defines permissions for physical addresses. It mostly protects M-mode memory from S-mode and U-mode
access. Hazard3 only implements M-mode and U-mode.
A PMP region applies read, write and execute permissions to a span of byte addresses. For each region there is one
address register, PMPADDR0 through PMPADDR15, and an 8-bit configuration field packed into PMPCFG0 through
PMPCFG3. The read, write and execute permissions are always enforced for U-mode. They may also be enforced for M-
mode, depending on the PMPCFG L bit for that region, and the PMPCFGM0 register.
RP2350 configures Hazard3’s PMP hardware with the following features:
3.8. Hazard3 processor 279

- 8 ×^ dynamically configurable regions,^0 through^7
- 3 ×^ statically configured (hardwired) regions,^8 through^10
- (Remaining regions^11 through^15 are hardwired to^ OFF)
- A granule of 32 bytes
- Support for naturally aligned power of two (NAPOT) region shapes only
- The custom PMPCFGM0 CSR can apply M-mode permissions to individual regions without locking them
Section 3.8.8.1 defines the configuration of the hardwired regions 8 through 10. These regions apply default U-mode
permissions to RP2350 ROM and peripherals, to avoid having to spend dynamic regions to cover these addresses. The
system-level ACCESSCTRL registers (Section 10.6) can assign each peripheral individually to M-mode or U-mode.
When multiple PMP regions match the same byte address, the lowest-numbered of these regions takes effect. The
other regions are ignored.

###### 3.8.3.1. PMP address registers

```
Addresses in PMP address registers PMPADDR0 through PMPADDR15 are stored with a right-shift of two, so that they
can cover a 16 GB physical address space when Sv32 address translation is in effect. Hazard3 does not implement
address translation, so the physical address space is 4 GB (32-bit byte-addressed) and the two MSBs of each address
register are hardwired to zero.
The RP2350 configuration of Hazard3 supports only the OFF and NAPOT values for the PMPCFG A fields (e.g.
PMPCFG0.R0_A). Setting A to OFF means the region matches no bytes, and is effectively disabled. Setting A to NAPOT
means the region matches on a naturally aligned span of bytes (the base address modulo the size is zero) whose size is
a power of two.
The number of trailing 1 s in the PMP address value encodes the size of an NAPOT region. This is the number of
consecutive 1 s counted from the LSB without reaching a 0. A PMP address value with no trailing ones (ending in a 0 )
matches a region eight bytes in size, and the region size is doubled with each additional 1 bit.
The PMP region matches on the address bits to the left of the least-significant 0 bit. Because the PMP address registers
are right-shifted by two, you must apply the same shift to the addresses being compared. The following examples
demonstrate how to match addresses based on PMPADDRx values:
```
- The 30-bit all-ones bit pattern^ 0x3fffffff^ has the maximum possible size, and matches all addresses.
- The all-zeroes bit pattern^ 0x00000000^ has the minimum possible size.

### ◦ Since there are no trailing^1 s, this matches starting from bit^1 of the PMP address register.

### ◦ Due to addresses being right-shifted by two, this is a region of eight bytes starting from address^ 0x0.

- The bit pattern^ 0x???????7^ (where^?^ is any digit) matches any 64-byte region.

### ◦ Shift the base address of this 64-byte region by two to get bits^ 29:4^ of the^ PMPADDRx^ value.

- The bit pattern^ 0x0800000f^ matches byte addresses between^ 0x20000000^ and^ 0x2000007f, the first 128 bytes of SRAM.

### ◦ Right-shift the base address (0x20000000) by two to get^ 0x08000000.

### ◦ Add trailing ones to increase the region size and get the final value of^ 0x0800000f.

### ◦ The size of the region is eight bytes times two to the power of the number of trailing^1 bits, which in this case

(four 1 s) works out to 8 × 24 = 128 bytes.
For more examples of PMP address match patterns, see the hardwired PMP region values in Section 3.8.8.1.
RP2350 configures Hazard3 with a granule of 32 bytes. This means the two least-significant bits of each PMP address
register are hardwired to all-ones when the region is enabled. The hardware does not decode address regions smaller
than 32 bytes.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 280

###### 3.8.3.2. PMP permissions

Each 8-bit PMP configuration field contains three permission flags:

- R^ permits non-instruction-fetch reads:

### ◦ load instructions

### ◦ the read phase of AMOs

- W^ permits writes:

### ◦ store instructions

### ◦ the write phase of AMOs

- X^ permits instruction execution
A 1 value for each permission means it is granted, and a 0 means it is revoked. These permissions apply to U-mode
access to the region. They also apply to M-mode accesses when any of the following is true:
- The^ L^ (lock) configuration bit is^1
- The Hazard3 custom PMPCFGM0 register bit for this region is^1
The L (lock) bit also locks the associated PMP address register and 8-bit PMP configuration field, so that it ignores
future writes. You should always lock PMP regions consecutively from region 0 , so that locked regions cannot be
bypassed by unlocked regions.
U-mode accesses that match no PMP regions have no permissions: all memory accesses fail. M-mode accesses that
match no PMP regions have all permissions. The hardwired PMP regions in Section 3.8.8.1 define additional U-mode
permissions for the ROM and peripheral address ranges: these can be overridden by enabling any of the dynamically
configured regions.

######  NOTE

```
Due to RP2350-E6 the field order in the PMP configuration fields is R, W, X (MSB-first) rather than the standard X, W, R.
The SDK register headers match the as-implemented order.
```
###### 3.8.3.3. Accesses spanning multiple PMP regions

```
Hazard3 does not support non-naturally-aligned loads or stores, other than to generate standard exceptions when they
are attempted. Since NAPOT PMP regions are always naturally aligned, it is impossible for a load or store to span two
PMP regions. Therefore, all bytes covered by a load or store instruction are determined by at most a single active PMP
region that matches the lowest byte address accessed by that instruction.
Instructions are up to 32 bits in size with as little as 16-bit alignment. Therefore it is possible for an instruction to match
multiple PMP regions. When this happens, the instruction generates an instruction fault exception, (mcause = 0x1), unless
there is a lower-numbered PMP region that fully covers the instruction. Lower-numbered PMP regions take precedence.
The exact quote from the privileged ISA specification is: "The lowest-numbered PMP entry that matches any byte of an
access determines whether that access succeeds or fails. The matching PMP entry must match all bytes of an access, or
the access fails, irrespective of the L, R, W, and X bits." (page 60 of RISC-V privileged ISA manual version 20211203).
The RISC-V specification is flexible in what is considered a single access for the purposes of memory protection
checking. Hazard3 considers the fetch of one instruction to be a single access. It therefore forbids instruction fetches
that straddle two PMP regions, even if both regions grant execute permission. Due to this architecture rule, portable
RISC-V software must not assume it can execute instructions that span multiple PMP regions.
Avoid this issue by using hole-punching region configurations in preference to glueing configurations. Suppose you want
to cover the first 12 kB of SRAM (0x20000000 → 0x20002fff), this can be achieved in two ways:
```
- One region adding permissions to^ 0x20000000^ →^ 0x200001fff, and another region adding permissions to^ 0x20002000^ →
    0x20002fff
3.8. Hazard3 processor 281

- One region adding permissions to^ 0x20000000^ →^ 0x20003fff, and a lower-numbered region^ subtracting^ permissions
    from 0x20003000 → 0x20003fff
The former option has a crack between the two regions, which has potentially unwanted effects on some platforms. The
latter avoids this issue entirely.

#### 3.8.4. Interrupts and exceptions

```
In the RISC-V privileged ISA manual, a trap refers to either an interrupt or an exception:
Interrupt
A signal from outside the processor requests that it temporarily abandons its current task to deal with some
system-level event. The processor responds by transferring control to an interrupt handler function.
Exception
An instruction encounters a condition that prevents that instruction from completing normally. The processor
transfers control to an exception handler function to deal with the exceptional condition before it can resume
execution.
The two are closely related, and they are collectively referred to as traps to avoid stating everything twice.
Hardware performs the following steps automatically and atomically when entering a trap:
```
1. Save the address of the interrupted or excepting instruction to MEPC
2. Set the MSB of MCAUSE to indicate the cause is an interrupt, or clear it to indicate an exception
3. Write the detailed trap cause to the LSBs of the MCAUSE register
4. Save the current privilege level to MSTATUS.MPP
5. Set the privilege to M-mode (note Hazard3 does not implement S-mode)
6. Save the current value of MSTATUS.MIE to MSTATUS.MPIE
7. Disable interrupts by clearing MSTATUS.MIE
8. Jump to the correct offset from MTVEC depending on the trap cause

 (^) NOTE
The above sequence of events is standard and is also described in the RISC-V Privileged ISA Manual. See Section
3.8.1.1 for a list of links to RISC-V specifications.
All earlier instructions than the one pointed to by MEPC execute normally, and their effects are visible to the trap
handler. These earlier instructions are not affected by the exception or interrupt. On the other hand the instruction
pointed to by MEPC, and all later instructions, does not execute before entering the trap handler. These instructions
have no visible side effects, with the possible exception of load/store fault exceptions, where the bus fault itself may
have observable effects on the bus or peripheral.
Expanding on the MEPC behaviour in architectural terms, all traps are precise, meaning there exists some point in
program order where the trap handler observes all earlier instructions to have retired and all later instructions to have
not. The MEPC register indicates this point. All exceptions are also synchronous, meaning there is a particular
instruction that originated the trap, and the trap architecturally takes place in between that instruction and its
predecessors in program order.
M-mode software executes an mret instruction to return to the interrupted or excepting instruction at the end of a
handler. This largely reverses the process of entering the trap:

1. Restore core privilege level to the value of MSTATUS.MPP
2. Write 0 (U-mode) to MSTATUS.MPP
3.8. Hazard3 processor 282

3. Restore MSTATUS.MIE from MSTATUS.MPIE
4. Write 1 to MSTATUS.MPIE
5. Jump to the address in MEPC.
Often, the values restored on exit are exactly those values saved on entry. However this need not be the case, as all
CSRs mentioned above are read/writable by M-mode software at any time. Hand-manipulating the trap handling CSRs is
useful for low-level OS operations such as context switching, or to make exception handlers return to the instruction
after the trap point by incrementing MEPC before return. You can execute an mret without any prior trap, for example
when entering U-mode code from M-mode for the first time.
Hardware does not save or restore any other registers. In particular, it does not save the core GPRs, and software is
responsible for ensuring the execution of the handler does not perturb the foreground context. For an interrupt, this may
mean saving the core registers on the interruptee’s stack, or using the MSCRATCH CSR to swap the stack pointer before
saving registers on a dedicated interrupt stack. For a fatal exception this may be unimportant, as there is no
requirement for the handler to return.

###### 3.8.4.1. Exceptions

Exceptions occur for a variety of reasons. MCAUSE indicates the specific reason for the latest exception:
Cause Meaning
0x0 Instruction alignment: Does not occur on RP2350, because 16-bit compressed instructions are
implemented, and it is impossible to jump to a byte-aligned address.
0x1 Instruction fetch fault: Attempted to fetch from an address that does not support instruction fetch (like
APB/AHB peripherals on RP2350), or lacks PMP execute permission, or is forbidden by ACCESSCTRL, or
returned a fault from the memory device itself.
0x2 Illegal instruction: Encountered an instruction that was not a valid RISC-V opcode implemented by this
processor, or attempted to access a nonexistent CSR, or attempted to execute a privileged instruction or
access a privileged CSR without sufficient privilege.
0x3 Breakpoint: An ebreak or c.ebreak instruction was executed, and no external debug host caught it (
DCSR.EBREAKM or DCSR.EBREAKU was not set).
0x4 Load alignment: Attempted to load from an address that was not a multiple of access size.
0x5 Load fault: Attempted to load from an address that does not exist, or lacks PMP read permissions, or is
forbidden by ACCESSCTRL, or returned a fault from a peripheral.
0x6 Store/AMO alignment: Attempted to write to an address that was not a multiple of access size.
0x7 Store/AMO fault: Attempted to write to an address that does not exist, or lacks PMP write permissions, or
is forbidden by ACCESSCTRL, or returned a fault from a peripheral. Also raised when attempting an AMO
on an address that does not support AHB5 exclusives.
0x8 An ecall instruction was executed in U-mode.
0xb An ecall instruction was executed in M-mode.
Exceptions jump to exactly the address of MTVEC, no matter the cause and no matter whether vectoring is enabled.
The MSTATUS.MIE global interrupt enable does not affect exception entry. You can still take an exception and trap into
the exception handler when exceptions are disabled.
Returning from an exception will jump to MEPC, which hardware sets to the address of the excepting instruction before
entering the exception handler. This means by default you will return to the exact same instruction that caused the
exception. When emulating illegal instructions, you should increment mepc before returning, so that execution resumes
after the problematic instruction.
Hazard3 hardwires mtval to zero. To emulate a misaligned load/store instruction you must decode the instruction and
3.8. Hazard3 processor 283

```
read the spilled register state to calculate the address, and to emulate an illegal instruction you must read the
instruction bits from memory yourself by dereferencing mepc.
```
###### 3.8.4.2. Interrupts

```
Hazard3 implements the standard RISC-V interrupt scheme with a single external interrupt routed to MIP.MEIP, and the
standard timer and soft interrupts routed to MTIP and MSIP. An interrupt controller such as a standard RISC-V PLIC can
be integrated externally to route multiple interrupts through to the single external interrupt line. Alternatively, the
Hazard3 interrupt controller (see Xh3irq extension, Section 3.8.6.1) multiplexes multiple external interrupts onto
MIP.MEIP in such a way that interrupts can efficiently pre-empt one another, with configurable dynamic priority per
interrupt.
RP2350 configures Hazard3 with the Xh3irq interrupt controller, with 52 external interrupt lines and 16 levels of pre-
emption priority. The IRQ numbers for the system-level interrupts, documented in Section 3.2, are the same on both Arm
and RISC-V.
The core enters an interrupt when all of the following are true:
```
- MSTATUS.MIE is set
- An interrupt pending bit in the standard MIP CSR is set
- The matching interrupt enable in the standard MIE CSR is also set
When vectoring is disabled (LSB of MTVEC is clear), interrupts transfer control directly to the address indicated by mtvec.
Setting the LSB enables vectoring: interrupts transfer control to the address mtvec + 4 * cause, where the interrupt cause
is one of:
- meip:^ cause^ =^11
- mtip:^ cause^ =^7
- msip:^ cause^ =^3
The pointer written to mtvec must be word-aligned (4 bytes). Additionally, when vectoring is enabled, it must be aligned
to the size of the table, rounded up to a power of two. This works out to 64-byte alignment. On RP2350, mtvec is fully
writable except for bit 1 , which is hardwired to zero as it is only used for additional vectoring modes not supported by
Hazard3.
When multiple interrupts are active, hardware picks one to enter, in the order meip > msip > mtip. (This is not quite the
same order as the cause values.)
3.8.4.2.1. RISC-V interrupt signals
The standard timer interrupt MIP.MTIP connects to the RISC-V platform timer in the SIO subsystem (Section 3.1.8). This
is a 64-bit timer with a per-core 64-bit comparison value. The interrupt is asserted whenever the timer is greater than or
equal to the comparison value, and de-asserts automatically when less than. The same interrupt signal also appears in
the system-level IRQs, as SIO_IRQ_MTIMECMP (IRQ 29). The timer is a standard RISC-V peripheral, often used by operating
systems to generate context switch interrupts.
The standard software interrupt MIP.MSIP connects to the RISCV_SOFTIRQ register in the SIO subsystem. The register
has a single bit per hart, which asserts the soft IRQ interrupt to that hart. This can be used to interrupt the other hart, or
to interrupt yourself as though the other hart had interrupted you, which can help to make handler code more
symmetric. On RP2350 there is a one-to-one correspondence between harts and cores, so you could equivalently say
there is one soft IRQ per core.
Hazard3’s internal interrupt controller drives the MIP.MEIP external interrupt pending bit based on its internal state and
the system-level interrupt signals, to transfer control to the interrupt vector when it is both safe and necessary. Section
3.8.6.1 describes the Xh3irq interrupt controller in depth.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 284

```
3.8.4.2.2. Interrupt calling convention
The default SDK hardware_irq library expects function pointers registered for system-level IRQs to be normal C functions.
There must be no __attribute__((interrupt)) on an interrupt handler passed into functions such as
set_exclusive_irq_handler(). This is an API detail that is consistent across all architectures supported by the SDK. Using
regular C calling convention is also efficient under heavy interrupt load, because the cost of saving/restoring all caller
save and temporary registers can be amortised over multiple interrupt handlers due to tail sharing, and a save triggered
by a low-priority IRQ can be taken over by a high-priority IRQ that asserted during the save.
Conversely, handlers registered for the standard RISC-V mtip and msip interrupts via the SDK
irq_set_riscv_vector_handler() function must be __attribute__((interrupt)). In terms of the generated code, this means
they should use save-as-you-go calling convention, and end with an mret. These interrupts are entered directly by the
hardware without any intermediate dispatch code.
As software is responsible for the dispatch to individual system interrupt handlers from the meip vector, it is possible to
support other interrupt calling conventions by supplying a different implementation for the dispatch.
```
#### 3.8.5. Debug

```
RISC-V debug specification
Hazard3 implements version 0.13.2 of the RISC-V External Debug Support specification, available at:
riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/riscv-debug-release.pdf
RP2350 implements a single RISC-V Debug Module, which enables debug access to the two Hazard3 processor
instances. Hazard3 should be supported by any debug translator implementing version 0.13.2 of the RISC-V External
Debug Support specification, but some details of its implementation-defined behaviour are described here for
completeness. The Debug Module source code, available in the Hazard3 repository, can be consulted to answer more
detailed questions about the debug implementation.
As configured on RP2350, Hazard3 supports the following standard RISC-V debug features:
```
- Run/halt/reset control of each processor
- Halt-on-reset support for all processors
- Hart array mask register, for halting/resuming multiple processors simultaneously
- Abstract access to GPRs
- Program Buffer: 2 words with an implicit^ ebreak^ (impebreak)
- Automatic trigger of abstract commands (abstractauto)
- System Bus Access, arbitrated with core 1’s load/store port
- An instruction address trigger unit with four hardware breakpoints

###### 3.8.5.1. Accessing the Debug Module

The Debug Module is accessed through a CoreSight APB-AP, which can be accessed in one of two ways:

- Externally, through the system’s SW-DP (see Section 3.5)
- Internally, via self-hosted debug (see Section 3.5.6)
The APB-AP for the Debug Module is located at offset 0xa000 in the debug address space. The Debug Module starts at
address 0 in the APB-AP’s downstream address space. The Debug Module addresses registers in increments of four
bytes, as APB is byte-addressed rather than word-addressed. This means the Debug Module register addresses listed in
the RISC-V debug specification must be multiplied by four.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 285

###### 3.8.5.2. Harts

```
Each Hazard3 core possesses exactly one hardware thread, or hart. This means each processor executes only a single
stream of instructions at a time. The two Hazard3 processor cores on RP2350, core 0 and 1, have hart IDs of 0 and 1
respectively. These values can be read from the MHARTID register on each processor, and match the values read from
the CPUID register in SIO.
The dmcontrol.hartsel field in RP2350’s Debug Module supports writing the values 0 and 1 only (it implements only a
single writable bit), and these correspond to hart IDs 0 and 1, which execute on core 0 and core 1 respectively.
```
###### 3.8.5.3. Resets

```
The dmcontrol.hartreset field resets the selected cores only. This can be a single core selected by dmcontrol.hartsel, or
multiple cores selected by the hart array mask. It does not reset cores that are not selected, nor does it reset any other
system hardware. There is a one-to-one correspondence between harts and cores on this system.
The dmcontrol.ndmreset field resets both cores. It does not reset any other hardware. As per the specification: "Exactly
what is affected by this reset is implementation dependent, as long as it is possible to debug programs from the first
instruction executed."
```
###### 3.8.5.4. Implementation-defined behaviour

The following are not implemented:

- Abstract access memory
- Abstract access CSR
- Post-incrementing abstract access GPR
The core behaves as follows:
- Branch,^ jal,^ jalr^ and^ auipc^ are illegal in Debug mode, because they observe PC: attempting to execute will halt
Program Buffer execution and report an exception in abstractcs.cmderr
- The^ dret^ instruction is not implemented (a special purpose DM-to-core signal is used to signal resume)
- The^ dscratch^ CSRs are not implemented
- The Debug Module’s^ data0^ register is mapped into the core as a CSR, DMDATA0
- dcsr.stepie^ is hardwired to 0 (no interrupts during single stepping)
- dcsr.stopcount^ and^ dcsr.stoptime^ are hardwired to 1 (no counter or internal timer increment in Debug mode)
- dcsr.mprven^ is hardwired to 0
- dcsr.prv^ accepts only the values^3 (M-mode) and^0 (U-mode), rounding to nearest on write
For more details on the core-side Debug mode registers, see DCSR and DPC.
The trigger unit implements four exact instruction address match triggers. Triggers can be configured to trap to M-
mode as well as Debug-mode, meaning M-mode can use triggers for self-hosted hardware breakpoint support. The
tcontrol.mte and tcontrol.mpte fields are implemented to avoid infinite exception loops when an M-mode trigger is set on
the M-mode exception handler.

#### 3.8.6. Custom extensions

Hazard3 implements a small number of custom extensions. All are optional: custom extensions are only included if the
relevant feature flags are set to 1 when instantiating the processor (Section 3.8.8). Hazard3 is always a conforming
RISC-V implementation; when these extensions are disabled, it is also a standard RISC-V implementation.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 286

If any one of these extensions is enabled, the x bit in MISA is set to indicate the presence of a non-standard extension.

###### 3.8.6.1. Xh3irq: Hazard3 interrupt controller

```
Xh3irq controls up to 512 external interrupts, with up to 16 levels of pre-emption. It is architected as a layer on top of the
standard mip.meip external interrupt line, and all standard RISC-V interrupt behaviour still applies. This extension adds no
new instructions, but does add several CSRs:
```
- MEIEA: external interrupt enable array
- MEIPA: external interrupt pending array
- MEIFA: external interrupt force array
- MEIPRA: external interrupt priority array
- MEINEXT: get next external interrupt
- MEICONTEXT: external interrupt context register
Xh3irq is geared towards supporting interrupt handlers as bare C functions, with dispatch implemented in software and
pre-emption priority logic implemented in hardware. However, the exact interrupt ABI is up to the implementation of the
soft dispatch routine installed as the mip.meip external interrupt handler.
3.8.6.1.1. Array CSRs
RISC-V CSRs are ideal for interrupt controls because they are closely coupled to the processor, offer native atomic
set/clear accesses, and can be accessed in a single instruction without first having to materialise an address. However
there are issues with using CSRs for large bit arrays, such as interrupt enables:
- The CSR address space is limited
- CSRs can not be addressed indirectly, so are difficult to iterate over
- Using a CSR to index other CSRs is problematic for interrupt handlers due to additional mutable state
Xh3irq uses the array CSR idiom to expose a large bit vector at a single CSR address, such as MEIEA. The upper half of
the CSR is a 16-bit window into the array, and the window is indexed by the LSBs of the write data for the same CSR
instruction.
For example, the following assembly code writes 0xa5a5 to bits 47:32 of the interrupt enable array, since the window
index is 0x2 and the window is 16 bits in size:
li a0, 0xa5a50002
csrw RVCSR_MEIEA_OFFSET, a0
The following reads bits 63:48 of the interrupt pending array into register a0, since the index is 0x3, and a CSR set of
0x0000 does not modify the window contents:
csrrsi a0, RVCSR_MEIPA_OFFSET, 0x3
Setting an arbitrary IRQ enable from C works as follows:
void enable_irq(uint irq) {
uint index = irq / 16;
uint32_t mask = 1u << (irq % 16);
asm (
3.8. Hazard3 processor 287

"csrs 0xbe0, %0\n"
: : "r" (index | (mask << 16))
);
}
Getting an arbitrary IRQ pending flag from C is as follows:
bool check_irq_pending(uint irq) {
uint index = irq / 16;
uint32_t csr_rdata;
asm (
"csrrs %0, 0xbe1, %1\n"
: "=r" (csr_rdata)
: "r" (index)
);
csr_rdata >>= 16;
return csr_rdata & (1u << (irq % 16));
}
The SDK implements similar operations in the hardware_irq API.
Hazard3 supports up to 512 interrupts, which is one 16-bit window for each of the possible values of a 5-bit CSR
immediate.
3.8.6.1.2. Enable, pending, and force arrays
The MEIEA, MEIPA and MEIFA CSRs expose the interrupt enable, pending and force arrays respectively. Each array
contains one bit per system-level interrupt line, of which there are 52 lines in total. (See Section 3.2 for the assignment
of system IRQ numbers to peripherals.)
The interrupt enable array gates the entry of interrupt signals into the core. When a bit is clear in MEIEA, the
corresponding interrupt signal is ignored. When a bit is set, assertion of the corresponding interrupt signal will send the
core to the meip vector as soon as it is safe and appropriate to do so. From there, the meip handler vectors to the correct
handler, after saving the interruptee’s context.
The SDK irq_set_enabled() function in the hardware_irq library is a convenient way to manipulate the interrupt enable
array.
The interrupt pending array displays the current status of the system-level interrupt signals. Interrupts are visible in
MEIPA even if the corresponding bit is clear in MEIEA, and even if the interrupt has insufficient priority to interrupt the
core at this time. This register is read-only: bits in MEIPA clear automatically when the corresponding interrupt source
de-asserts. For example, a UART RX FIFO interrupt should clear on its own after data has been read from the FIFO.
The interrupt force array causes interrupts to appear pending, even when the corresponding system-level interrupt
signal is de-asserted. When a bit is set in MEIFA, the corresponding bit in MEIPA reads as 1, and will interrupt the core if
it meets the usual prerequisites.
MEIFA bits clear automatically when the corresponding interrupt is sampled from MEINEXT. It is not necessary to write
a 1 bit to MEINEXT.UPDATE for the interrupt force bit to clear. This means setting an MEIFA bit should cause the
interrupt to be taken once. Normal csrw and csrc instructions will also clear MEIFA.
Six spare interrupt lines 46 through 51 , referred to as SPAREIRQ_IRQ_0 through SPAREIRQ_IRQ_5 in the SDK, deliberately do not
connect to system-level hardware. However they are still fully implemented in the interrupt controller, and fire when set
pending in MEIFA. For example, a fast interrupt top-half handler can schedule its longer-running bottom half to run at a
lower priority, or a high-priority context switch interrupt might schedule a context switch to take place at a lower priority
in order to clear interrupt frames off the stack.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 288

```
3.8.6.1.3. Next interrupt register
MEINEXT always displays the next interrupt that should be handled, taking priority order into account. Interrupts appear
in MEINEXT when they meet all of the following criteria:
```
1. Pending in MEIPA
2. Enabled in MEIEA
3. Of priority greater than or equal to MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT
The value returned is the IRQ number of the highest-priority interrupt that meets these three criteria, left-shifted by two.
When multiple interrupts have the highest priority, the lowest-numbered of those interrupts is chosen, as a tie-break.
The MSB of MEINEXT is set to indicate there were no eligible interrupts, and the remaining bits are undefined in this
case. Software should repeatedly read MEINEXT until all available interrupts are exhausted. The bltz and bgez
instructions are a convenient way to test the MSB of a register.
The purpose of rule 3 above is to ensure that any interrupt that may already be in progress in a pre-empted interrupt
frame is not re-entered in the current frame. Without this rule, multiple executions of the same interrupt handler could be
interleaved due to pre-emption by other handlers. Programmers are usually surprised when this happens.
MEINEXT.UPDATE is a write-only field which instructs hardware to update MEICONTEXT with information about the
interrupt displayed in MEINEXT on that cycle. Section 3.8.6.1.5 goes into more detail about context register updates.

 (^) IMPORTANT
MEINEXT is constantly changing as interrupt signals come and go. The write to MEINEXT.UPDATE must be the
same instruction that reads the interrupt index from MEINEXT to avoid a data race. This can be achieved with a csrrw
or csrrwi instruction.
3.8.6.1.4. Interrupt priority
The interrupt priority array MEIPRA implements a four-bit field per interrupt. In hardware, numerically higher (unsigned)
MEIPRA values have higher priority, taking precedence over lower-priority interrupts. The irq_set_priority() SDK
function uses the opposite convention, with lower numeric values indicating greater precedence. This section uses the
hardware numbering.
The interrupt priority in MEIPRA determines three things:

1. Whether the interrupt source is permitted to interrupt the core at this moment: must be greater than or equal
    MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT
2. Whether the interrupt source can appear in MEINEXT: must be greater than or equal to MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT
3. What order this interrupt will appear in when there are multiple candidates for MEINEXT
When MEICONTEXT is correctly saved and restored, PREEMPT and PPREEMPT are both zero outside of interrupt
handlers, and PREEMPT is strictly greater than PPREEMPT when inside an interrupt handler. Together they define the
band of interrupt priorities which may be processed without any pushing or popping of interrupt stack frames.
Manipulating interrupt priority outside of interrupts is safe. There is no need to disable interrupts when writing to the
priority array. Manipulating interrupt priority inside of an interrupt handler requires care: hardware operation is well-
defined, but the results can be surprising. Be wary of the following cases:
1. Increasing the priority of the current handler: if still enabled and pending, you will instantly pre-empt yourself.
2. Increasing the priority of a different interrupt, with priority lower than MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT: this interrupt may
already be in progress in a frame that was pre-empted in order to run your handler. Increasing the priority may
cause it to execute in a higher frame before returning to the original frame where it is still in progress, thereby
interleaving with its own execution.
PPREEMPT is guaranteed to be no greater than the current handler priority if MEICONTEXT is correctly saved/restored,
since it contains the previous value of PREEMPT at the time a pre-emption took place, and interrupts lower than
3.8. Hazard3 processor 289

```
PREEMPT can not interrupt the core. Therefore a safe approximation for case 2 above is: do not increase (by any
amount) the priority of a handler with lower priority than the currently running handler.
If an interrupt must increase the priority of a lower-priority interrupt, one solution is to queue up interrupt priority
updates, and pend a lowest-priority handler assigned to one of the spare IRQs, which processes the enqueued updates.
You can pend this handler manually by setting its bit in MEIFA. The handler will run last thing before returning to
foreground code. This is safe because an interrupt of the lowest priority by definition can not have pre-empted any other
interrupts.
3.8.6.1.5. Interrupt context management
The MEICONTEXT register has two functions: manage the core pre-emption priority across multiple pre-empting
interrupt stack frames, and help software track which interrupt handler it is currently executing, if any.
MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT, MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT and MEICONTEXT.PPPREEMPT form a three-level stack of pre-
emption priorities:
```
- PREEMPT^ sets the minimum interrupt priority which interrupts the core
- PPREEMPT^ sets the minimum interrupt priority which appears in MEINEXT: this avoids redundant execution of
    interrupt handlers which may have been pre-empted
- PPPREEMPT^ has no hardware function other than save/restore of^ PPREEMPT
When entering the MIP.MEIP vector, hardware atomically performs the following updates to MEICONTEXT
simultaneous to the standard trap entry sequence described in Section 3.8.4:
1. Save the current value of MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT to PPPREEMPT
2. Save the current value of MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT to PPREEMPT
3. Write one plus the priority of the IRQ which caused this interrupt to MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT
4. Write 1 to MEICONTEXT.MRETEIRQ, to enable priority restore on next mret
The standard trap entry sequence includes clearing MSTATUS.MIE, so interrupts are disabled at the start of the handler.
To implement pre-emption, the MIP.MEIP handler must re-enable interrupts after its context save critical section. This
should include saving MEICONTEXT, MSTATUS, MEPC, and the caller-saved general-purpose registers.
Any trap entry not caused by MIP.MEIP clears MRETEIRQ. Trap exit (mret) also clears MRETEIRQ.
A trap exit where MEICONTEXT.MRETEIRQ is set atomically performs the following updates to MEICONTEXT
simultaneous to the standard trap exit sequence:
1. Restore MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT from MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT
2. Restore MEICONTEXT.PPREEMPT from MEICONTEXT.PPPREEMPT
3. Write 0 to MEICONTEXT.PPPREEMPT
The MRETEIRQ flag allows hardware to match each MIP.MEIP vector entry with its associated mret. This balances
pushes and pops of the PREEMPT priority stack. When there is no pre-emption, and no exceptions raised within
interrupt handlers, MRETEIRQ can be left in place in the MEICONTEXT.MRETEIRQ register. Otherwise, you must save
MEICONTEXT upon entering the external interrupt vector and restore it before the mret at the end of the handler.
Interrupts must be disabled during save/restore.
Writing 1 to MEINEXT.UPDATE updates MEICONTEXT as follows:
1. Write MEINEXT.NOIRQ to MEICONTEXT.NOIRQ
2. Write MEINEXT.IRQ (the IRQ number) to MEICONTEXT.IRQ
3. If MEINEXT.NOIRQ is...

### ◦ Clear: Write one plus the priority of MEINEXT.IRQ to MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT

3.8. Hazard3 processor 290

### ◦ Set: Write^ 0x10^ to MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT (greater than any interrupt priority in MEIPRA)

MEICONTEXT.IRQ and NOIRQ help code determine in which interrupt handler it is running. MEICONTEXT should be
saved/restored by interrupts which pre-empt the current one, so is safe to check these fields during the handler.
The update to MEICONTEXT.PREEMPT upon writing MEINEXT.UPDATE ensures the core will be pre-empted by
interrupts higher-priority than the one it is about to enter. Equally important, it ensures the core is not pre-empted by
lower or equal priority interrupts, including the one whose handler it is about to enter.
To avoid awkward interactions between the MIP.MEIP handler, which should be aware of the Xh3irq extension, and the
MTIP/MSIP handlers, which may not be, it’s best to avoid pre-emption of the former by the latter.
MEICONTEXT.CLEARTS, MTIESAVE and MSIESAVE support disabling and restoring the timer/software interrupt
enables as part of the MEICONTEXT CSR accesses that take place during context save/restore in the MEIP handler.
3.8.6.1.6. Minimal handler example
This example demonstrates a minimal meip handler which dispatches to an array of C-function interrupt handlers,
without enabling pre-emption. In this case the priorities configured in MEIPRA still determine the order in which
interrupts are entered when multiple are asserted, but when an interrupt handler starts running, no other interrupts are
serviced until that handler completes.

Since the handler loops on meinext until no more interrupts are pending, multiple interrupts are processed with a single
save/restore of the caller saves and temporaries.
The pending status of each IRQ in MEIPA clears when the corresponding peripheral de-asserts its interrupt output. A
correctly programmed interrupt handler should cause the peripheral interrupt to de-assert, so each successive read
from meinext will return a new interrupt. Because meinext always returns the highest-priority active interrupt, this loop
iterates over active interrupts in descending priority order.
The overhead of performing the register save/restore in software is minimal because the save/restore routine is limited
by bus bandwidth, not by instruction execution overhead. This also makes the hardware more flexible because the same
hardware can support multiple interrupt ABIs.
```
###### 3.8.6.2. Xh3pmpm: M-mode PMP regions

```
This extension adds a new M-mode CSR, PMPCFGM0, which allows a PMP region to be enforced in M-mode without
locking the region.
This is useful when the PMP is used for non-security-related purposes such as stack guarding, or trapping and
emulation of peripheral accesses.
```
###### 3.8.6.3. Xh3power: Hazard3 power management

This extension adds a new M-mode CSR (MSLEEP), and two new hint instructions, h3.block and h3.unblock, in the slt
nop-compatible custom hint space.
The msleep CSR controls how deeply the processor sleeps in the WFI sleep state. By default, a WFI is implemented as a
3.8. Hazard3 processor 292

normal pipeline stall. By configuring msleep appropriately, the processor can gate its own clock when asleep or, with a
simple 4-phase req/ack handshake, negotiate power up/down of external hardware with an external power controller.
These options can improve the sleep current at the cost of greater wakeup latency.
The hints allow processors to sleep until woken by other processors in a multiprocessor environment. They are
implemented on top of the standard WFI state, which means they interact in the same way with external debug, and
benefit from the same deep sleep states in msleep.
3.8.6.3.1. h3.block
Enter a WFI sleep state until either an unblock signal is received, or an interrupt is asserted that would cause a WFI to
exit.
If mstatus.tw is set, attempting to execute this instruction in privilege modes lower than M-mode will generate an illegal
instruction exception.
If an unblock signal has been received in the time since the last h3.block, this instruction executes as a nop, and the
processor does not enter the sleep state. Conceptually, the sleep state falls through immediately because the
corresponding unblock signal has already been received.
An unblock signal is received when a neighbouring processor (the exact definition of "neighbouring" being left to the
implementer) executes an h3.unblock instruction, or for some other platform-defined reason.
This instruction is encoded as slt x0, x0, x0, which is part of the custom nop-compatible hint encoding space.
Example C macro:
#define __h3_block() asm ("slt x0, x0, x0")
Example assembly macro:
.macro h3.block
slt x0, x0, x0
.endm
3.8.6.3.2. h3.unblock
Post an unblock signal to other processors in the system. For example, to notify another processor that a work queue is
now non-empty.
If mstatus.tw is set, attempting to execute this instruction in privilege modes lower than M-mode will generate an illegal
instruction exception.
This instruction is encoded as slt x0, x0, x1, which is part of the custom nop-compatible hint encoding space.
Example C macro:
#define __h3_unblock() asm ("slt x0, x0, x1")
Example assembly macro:
3.8. Hazard3 processor 293

```
.macro h3.unblock
slt x0, x0, x1

###### 3.8.7.4. C extension

```
All C extension 16-bit instructions are aliases of base RV32I instructions. On Hazard3, they perform identically to their
32-bit counterparts.
A consequence of the C extension is that 32-bit instructions can be non-naturally-aligned. This has no penalty during
sequential execution, but branching to a 32-bit instruction that is not 32-bit-aligned carries a 1 cycle penalty, because
the instruction fetch is cracked into two naturally-aligned bus accesses.

###### 3.8.7.9. Table footnotes

[1] (^) A jump or branch to a 32-bit instruction that isn’t 32-bit-aligned requires one additional cycle because two
naturally aligned bus cycles are required to fetch the target instruction.
[2] (^) If an instruction in stage 2 (e.g. an add) uses data from stage 3 (e.g. a lw result), a 1-cycle bubble is inserted
between the pair. A load data → store data dependency is not an example of this, because data is
produced and consumed in stage 3. However, load data → load address would qualify, as would e.g. sc.w
→ beqz.
[3] (^) AMOs are issued as a paired exclusive read and exclusive write on the bus, at the maximum speed of 2
cycles per access, since the bus does not permit pipelining of exclusive reads/writes. If the write phase
fails due to the global monitor reporting a lost reservation, the instruction loops at a rate of 4 cycles per
loop, until success. If the read reservation is refused by the global monitor, the instruction generates a
Store/AMO Fault exception, to avoid an infinite loop.
[4] (^) A pipeline bubble is inserted between lr.w/sc.w and an immediately-following lr.w/sc.w/amo*, because the
AHB5 bus standard does not permit pipelined exclusive accesses. A stall would be inserted between lr.w
and sc.w anyhow, so the local monitor can be updated based on the lr.w data phase in time to suppress the
sc.w address phase.
[5] (^) The single-register variants of cm.popret and cm.popretz take the same number of cycles as the two-register
variants, because of an internal load-use dependency on the loaded return address.
3.8. Hazard3 processor 300

###### 3.8.7.10. Branch predictor

Hazard3 includes a minimal branch predictor, to accelerate tight loops:

- The instruction frontend remembers the last taken, backward branch in a single-entry^ branch target buffer^ (BTB)
- If the same branch is seen again, it is predicted taken
- All other branches are predicted non-taken
- If the core executes but does not take a predicted-taken branch:

### ◦ The core clears the BTB

### ◦ The branch is predicted non-taken on its next execution

```
Correctly predicted branches execute in one cycle: the frontend is able to stitch together the two nonsequential fetch
paths so that they appear sequential. Mispredicted branches incur a penalty cycle, since a nonsequential fetch address
must be issued when the branch is executed. Consider the following copy routine:
// a0 is dst pointer
// a1 is src pointer
// a2 is len
copy_data:
beqz a2, 2f
add a2, a2, a1
1:
lbu a3, (a0)
sb a3, (a1)
addi a0, a0, 1
addi a1, a1, 1
bltu a1, a2, 1b
2:
ret
In the steady state this executes at 5 cycles per loop:
```
- One cycle for the load
- One cycle for the store: though it depends on the load, the dependency is within stage 3 so there is no stall
- One cycle for each^ add
- One cycle for the repeatedly-taken backward branch
Without the branch predictor the throughput is 6 cycles per loop. The branch predictor increases the throughput by 20%,
and also reduces energy dissipation due to wasted instruction fetch (memory access is a large fraction of the
instruction energy cost for an embedded processor).
For the above example code, a copy of 10 bytes would take 52 cycles:
- The base cost is 5 cycles per iteration, and there are 10 iterations
- The mispredicted, taken branch at the end of the first iteration costs one cycle
- The mispredicted, non-taken branch at the end of the last iteration costs one cycle
3.8.7.10.1. Caveat: delay loops
The branch predictor does not engage when all of the following are true:
- The loop body consists of a single 16-bit instruction (followed by a repeatedly taken backward branch)
- The loop body is 32-bit-aligned
3.8. Hazard3 processor 301

- There are no bus stalls on the instruction fetch port
This is because the branch predictor lookup functions by comparing bits 31:2 of the sequential-fetch counter to the BTB
tag. In this case the BTB tag points to the same word as the loop entry. In the aforementioned case the sequential-fetch
counter never actually contains the address of the loop entry, because the loop entry address goes straight to the bus,
and the sequential-fetch counter pre-increments to the next address. This manifests in delay loops like the following:
.p2align 2
delay_loop_bad_dont_copy_paste_this:
addi a0, a0, -1
bgez a0, delay_loop_bad_dont_copy_paste_this
Given the description in Section 3.8.7.10, you might expect this loop to execute at two cycles per iteration in the steady
state. The actual behaviour is it executes at three cycles per iteration until instruction fetch encounters a stall,
whereupon it accelerates to two cycles per instruction until the loop ends.
Avoid this by using a 32-bit instruction in the loop body. Force 32-bit alignment of the loop body to avoid an alignment
penalty. The following code executes at the expected two cycles per iteration in the steady state:
.p2align 2 // Force 4-byte alignment
delay_cycles:
.option push
.option norvc // Force 32-bit opcode
addi a0, a0, -1
.option pop
bgez a0, delay_cycles

#### 3.8.8. Configuration

Hazard3 uses the parameters given in the hazard3_config.vh header to customise the core. These values are set before
taping out a Hazard3 instance on silicon, so they are fixed from a user point of view. They determine which instructions
the processor supports, the area-performance trade-off for certain instructions, and static configuration for core
peripherals like the PMP. RP2350 uses the following values for these parameters:

###### 3.8.8.1. Hardwired PMP regions

```
RP2350 configures Hazard3 with eight dynamically configured PMP regions, and three static ones. The static regions
provide default U-mode RWX permissions on the following ranges:
```
- ROM:^ 0x00000000^ through^ 0x0fffffff
- Peripherals:^ 0x40000000^ through^ 0x5fffffff
- SIO:^ 0xd0000000^ through^ 0xdfffffff
These addresses appear in PMPADDR8, PMPADDR9 and PMPADDR10. The hardwired PMP address registers behave
the same as dynamic registers, except that they ignore writes (exercising the WARL rule). The permissions for these
3.8. Hazard3 processor 303

```
regions are in PMPCFG2.
The hardwired regions have a similar role to the Exempt regions added to the Cortex-M33 IDAU address map specified
in Section 10.2.2.
RP2350 puts default U-mode permissions on AHB/APB peripherals because these are expected to be assigned using
ACCESSCTRL (Section 10.6). ACCESSCTRL can assign each peripheral individually, using the existing address decoders
in the bus fabric, whereas PMP regions are in limited supply so are less useful for peripheral assignment.
Similarly, SIO has internal banking over Secure/Non-secure bus attribution, which is mapped onto Machine and User
modes as described in Section 10.6.2.
The dynamic regions 0 through 7 take priority over the hardwired regions, because the PMP prioritises lower-numbered
regions.
```
#### 3.8.9. Control and status registers

```
Control and status registers (CSRs) are registers internal to the processor that affect its behaviour. They are hart-local:
every hart has a copy of the CSRs. On RP2350 hart-local is a synonym for core-local.
Use dedicated CSR instructions to access the CSRs, as described in Section 3.8.1.22. You cannot access CSRs with
load or store instructions.
The RISC-V privileged specification is flexible on which CSRs are implemented, and how they behave. This section
documents the as-implemented behaviour of CSRs on Hazard3 specifically, and does not enumerate all possible
behaviour of all platforms.
```
 (^) IMPORTANT
The RISC-V Privileged Specification should be your primary reference for writing software to run on Hazard3.
Portable RISC-V software should not rely on any implementation-defined behaviour described in this section.
All CSRs are 32-bit, and MXLEN is fixed at 32 bits. CSR addresses not listed in this section are unimplemented.
Accessing an unimplemented CSR raises an illegal instruction exception (mcause = 2). This includes all S-mode CSRs.

Summary of ISA extension support
On RP2350, Hazard3’s full -march string is: rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb_zcmp
Note Zca is equivalent to the C extension in this case; all instructions from the RISC-V C extension relevant to a 32-bit
non-floating-point processor are supported. On older toolchains which do not support the Zc extensions, the appropriate
-march string is: rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb
In addition the following custom extensions are configured: Xh3bm, Xh3power, Xh3irq, Xh3pmpm

PMP is useful for non-security-related purposes, such as stack guarding and
peripheral emulation. This extension allows M-mode to freely use any
currently unlocked regions for its own purposes, without the inconvenience of
having to lock them.
Note that this does not grant any new capabilities to M-mode, since in the
base standard it is already possible to apply unlocked regions to M-mode by
locking them. In general, PMP regions should be locked in ascending region
number order so they can’t be subsequently overridden by currently unlocked
regions.
Note also that this is not the same as the rule locking bypass bit in the ePMP
extension, which does not permit locked and unlocked M-mode regions to
coexist.

#### RVCSR: MEIEA Register

Offset: 0xbe0
Description
External interrupt enable array.
The array contains a read-write bit for each external interrupt request: a 1 bit indicates that interrupt is currently enabled.
At reset, all external interrupts are disabled.
If enabled, an external interrupt can cause assertion of the standard RISC-V machine external interrupt pending flag
(mip.meip), and therefore cause the processor to enter the external interrupt vector. See meipa.
There are up to 512 external interrupts. The upper half of this register contains a 16-bit window into the full 512-bit
vector. The window is indexed by the 5 LSBs of the write data.

Description
External interrupt pending array
Contains a read-only bit for each external interrupt request. Similarly to meiea, this register is a window into an array of
up to 512 external interrupt flags. The status appears in the upper 16 bits of the value read from meipa, and the lower 5
bits of the value written by the same CSR instruction (or 0 if no write takes place) select a 16-bit window of the full
interrupt pending array.
A 1 bit indicates that interrupt is currently asserted. IRQs are assumed to be level-sensitive, and the relevant meipa bit is
3.8. Hazard3 processor 329

cleared by servicing the requestor so that it deasserts its interrupt request.
When any interrupt of sufficient priority is both set in meipa and enabled in meiea, the standard RISC-V external interrupt
pending bit mip.meip is asserted. In other words, meipa is filtered by meiea to generate the standard mip.meip flag.

#### RVCSR: MEIFA Register

Offset: 0xbe2
Description
External interrupt force array
Contains a read-write bit for every interrupt request. Writing a 1 to a bit in the interrupt force array causes the
corresponding bit to become pending in meipa. Software can use this feature to manually trigger a particular interrupt.
There are no restrictions on using meifa inside of an interrupt. The more useful case here is to schedule some lower-
priority handler from within a high-priority interrupt, so that it will execute before the core returns to the foreground
code. Implementers may wish to reserve some external IRQs with their external inputs tied to 0 for this purpose.
Bits can be cleared by software, and are cleared automatically by hardware upon a read of meinext which returns the
corresponding IRQ number in meinext.irq with mienext.noirq clear (no matter whether meinext.update is written).
meifa implements the same array window indexing scheme as meiea and meipa.

priority fields are hardwired to 0.
When an interrupt’s priority is lower than the current preemption priority meicontext.preempt, it is treated as not being
pending for the purposes of mip.meip. The pending bit in meipa will still assert, but the machine external interrupt pending
bit mip.meip will not, so the processor will ignore this interrupt. See meicontext.

When multiple interrupts of the same priority are both pending and enabled, the lowest-numbered wins. Interrupts with
priority less than meicontext.ppreempt — the previous preemption priority — are treated as though they are not pending.
This is to ensure that a preempting interrupt frame does not service interrupts which may be in progress in the frame
that was preempted.

#### RVCSR: MEICONTEXT Register

Offset: 0xbe5
Description
External interrupt context register
Configures the priority level for interrupt preemption, and helps software track which interrupt it is currently in. The latter
is useful when a common interrupt service routine handles interrupt requests from multiple instances of the same
peripheral.
A three-level stack of preemption priorities is maintained in the preempt, ppreempt and pppreempt fields. The priority stack is
saved when hardware enters the external interrupt vector, and restored by an mret instruction if meicontext.mreteirq is
set.
The top entry of the priority stack, preempt, is used by hardware to ensure that only higher-priority interrupts can preempt
the current interrupt. The next entry, ppreempt, is used to avoid servicing interrupts which may already be in progress in a
frame that was preempted. The third entry, pppreempt, has no hardware effect, but ensures that preempt and ppreempt can
be correctly saved/restored across arbitary levels of preemption.

1 CLEARTS: Write-1 self-clearing field. Writing 1 will clear mie.mtie and mie.msie,
and present their prior values in the mtiesave and msiesave of this register. This
makes it safe to re-enable IRQs (via mstatus.mie) without the possibility of
being preempted by the standard timer and soft interrupt handlers, which may
not be aware of Hazard3’s interrupt hardware.
The clear due to clearts takes precedence over the set due to mtiesave/
msiesave, although it would be unusual for software to write both on the same
cycle.
SC 0x0
0 MRETEIRQ: If 1, enable restore of the preemption priority stack on mret. This
bit is set on entering the external interrupt vector, cleared by mret, and cleared
upon taking any trap other than an external interrupt.
Provided meicontext is saved on entry to the external interrupt vector (before
enabling preemption), is restored before exiting, and the standard
software/timer IRQs are prevented from preempting (e.g. by using clearts),
this flag allows the hardware to safely manage the preemption priority stack
even when an external interrupt handler may take exceptions.

function of this is platform-defined — it may do nothing, it may do something
simple like clock-gating the fabric, or it may be tied to some complex system-

When waking, the processor reasserts its external power-up request, and will
not fetch any instructions until the request is acknowledged. This may add
considerable latency to the wakeup.

0 DEEPSLEEP: Deassert the processor clock enable when entering the sleep

## 3.9. Arm/RISC-V architecture switching

```
RP2350 supports both Arm and RISC-V processor architectures. SDK-based programs that don’t contain assembly code
typically run unmodified on either architecture by providing the appropriate build flag.
There are two processor sockets on RP2350, referred to as core 0 and core 1 throughout this document. Each socket
can be occupied either by a Cortex-M33 processor (implementing the Armv8-M Main architecture, plus extensions) or by
a Hazard3 processor (implementing the RV32IMAC architecture, plus extensions).
When a processor reset is removed, hardware samples the ARCHSEL register in the OTP control register block to
determine which processor to connect to that socket. The unused processor is held in reset indefinitely, with its clock
inputs gated. The default and allowable values of the ARCHSEL register are determined by critical OTP flags:
```
1. If CRIT0_ARM_DISABLE is set, only RISC-V is allowed.
2. Else if CRIT0_RISCV_DISABLE is set, only Arm is allowed.
3. Else if CRIT1_SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE is set, only Arm is allowed.
4. Else if CRIT1_BOOT_ARCH is set, both architectures are permitted, and the default is RISC-V.
5. If none of the above flags are set, both architectures are permitted, and the default is Arm.
No CRIT1 flags are set by default, so on devices where both architectures are available, the default is Arm. To change the
default architecture to RISC-V, set the CRIT1_BOOT_ARCH flag to 1.
Enabling secure boot disables the RISC-V cores because the RP2350 bootrom does not implement secure boot for
RISC-V. This prevents a bad actor from side-stepping secure boot by switching architectures.

 (^) NOTE
As of RP2350 A3 the CRIT0_ARM_DISABLE flag has no effect, removing a potential unlock path for debug on a secured
RP2350. Additionally, the combination of CRIT0_RISCV_DISABLE=1 and CRIT1_BOOT_ARCH=1 is decoded to an invalid state,
preventing boot.
RP2350 only samples the ARCHSEL register when a processor is reset. Its value is ignored at all other times, so
software can program the register before a watchdog reset to implement a software-initiated switch between
architectures.
Read the ARCHSEL_STATUS register to check the ARCHSEL value most recently sampled by each processor.

#### 3.9.1. Automatic switching

RP2350 binaries contain a binary marker recognised by the bootrom. This marker:

- contains additional information such as the binary’s entry point and the intended architecture: Arm, RISC-V, or both
- helps detect when a flash device is connected
- helps verify that the flash device was accessed using the correct SPI parameters
When booting with core 0 in Arm architecture mode, upon detecting a bootable RISC-V binary, the bootrom
automatically resets both cores and switches them to RISC-V architecture mode. After the reset, the bootrom detects
that the binary and processor architectures match, so the binary launches normally.
Likewise, when booting with core 0 in RISC-V architecture mode, upon detecting a bootable Arm binary, the bootrom
automatically resets both cores and switches them to Arm architecture mode.
3.9. Arm/RISC-V architecture switching 335

```
As a result, the USB bootloader, which runs on both Arm and RISC-V, can accept a UF2 image download for either
architecture, and automatically boot it using the correct processors.
```
#### 3.9.2. Mixed architecture combinations

The ARCHSEL register has one bit for each processor socket, so it is possible to request mixed combinations of Arm
and RISC-V processors: either Arm core 0 and RISC-V core 1, or RISC-V core 0 and Arm core 1.
Practical applications for this are limited, since this requires two separate program images. The two cores interoperate
normally, including shared exclusives via the global monitor: a shared variable can be safely, concurrently accessed by
an Arm processor performing ldrex, strex instructions and a RISC-V processor performing amoadd.w instructions, for
example.
Hardware supports debugging for a mixture of Arm and RISC-V processors, though this may prove challenging on the
host software side. Debug resources for unused processors are dynamically marked as non-PRESENT in the top-level
CoreSight ROM table.
