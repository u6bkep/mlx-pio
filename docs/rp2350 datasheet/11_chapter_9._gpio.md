# Chapter 9. GPIO

 (^) CAUTION
Under certain conditions, pull-down does not function as expected. For more information, see RP2350-E9.

## 9.1. Overview

```
RP2350 has up to 54 multi-functional General Purpose Input / Output (GPIO) pins, divided into two banks:
Bank 0
30 user GPIOs in the QFN-60 package (RP2350A), or 48 user GPIOs in the QFN-80 package
Bank 1
six QSPI IOs, and the USB DP/DM pins
You can control each GPIO from software running on the processors, or by a number of other functional blocks. To
meet USB rise and fall specifications, the analogue characteristics of the USB pins differ from the GPIO pads. As a
result, we do not include them in the 54 GPIO total. However, you can still use them for UART, I2C, or processor-
controlled GPIO through the single-cycle IO subsystem (SIO).
In a typical use case, the QSPI IOs are used to execute code from an external flash device, leaving 30 or 48 Bank 0
GPIOs for the programmer to use. The QSPI pins might become available for general purpose use when booting the chip
from internal OTP, or controlling the chip externally through SWD in an IO expander application.
All GPIOs support digital input and output. Several Bank 0 GPIOs can also be used as inputs to the chip’s Analogue to
Digital Converter (ADC):
```
## • GPIOs 26 through 29 inclusive (four total) in the QFN-60 package

## • GPIOs 40 through 47 (eight total) in the QFN-80 package

```
Bank 0 supports the following functions:
```

Bank 1 contains the QSPI and USB DP/DM pins and supports the following functions:
```
9.1. Overview 587

The logical structure of an example IO is shown in Figure 41.
Figure 41. Logicalstructure of a GPIO.
Each GPIO can be
controlled by one of anumber of peripherals,
or by software control
registers in the SIO.The function select
(FSEL) selects whichperipheral output is in
control of the GPIO’sdirection and output
level, and which
peripheral input cansee this GPIO’s input
level. These threesignals (output level,
output enable, inputlevel) can also be
inverted or forced high
or low, using the GPIOcontrol registers.

## 9.2. Changes from RP

```
RP2350 GPIO differs from RP2040 in the following ways:
```
- 18 more GPIOs in the QFN-80 package
- Addition of a third PIO to GPIO functions
- USB DP/DM pins can be used as GPIO
- Addition of isolation register to pad registers (preserves pad state while in a low power state, cleared by software
    on power up)
- Changed default reset state of pad controls
- Both Secure and Non-secure access to GPIOs (see Section 10.6)
- Double the number of GPIO interrupts to differentiate between Secure and Non-secure
- Interrupt summary registers added so you can quickly see which GPIOs have pending interrupts

## 9.3. Reset state

```
At first power up, Bank 0 IOs (GPIOs 0 through 29 in the QFN-60 package, and GPIOs 0 through 47 in the QFN-
package) assume the following state:
```
- Output buffer is high-impedance
- Input buffer is disabled
- Pulled low
- Isolation latches are set to latched (Section 9.7)
The pad output disable bit (GPIO0.OD) for each pad is clear at reset, but the IO muxing is reset to the null function,

9.2. Changes from RP2040 588

```
which ensures that the output buffer is high-impedance.
```
 (^) IMPORTANT
The pad reset state is different from RP2040, which only disables digital inputs on GPIOs 26 through 29 (as of
version B2) and does not have isolation latches. Applications must enable the pad input (GPIO0.IE = 1) and disable
pad isolation latches (GPIO0.ISO = 0) before using the pads for digital I/O. The gpio_set_function() SDK function
performs these tasks automatically.
Bank 1 IOs have the same reset state as Bank 0 GPIOs, except for the input enable (IE) resetting to 1, and different pull-
up/pull-down states: SCK, SD0 and SD1 are pull-down, but SD2, SD3 and CSn are pull-up.

####  NOTE

```
To use a Bank 0 GPIO as a second chip select, you need an external pull-up to ensure the second QSPI device does
not power up with its chip select asserted.
```
```
The pads return to the reset state on any of the following:
```
- A brownout reset
- Asserting the RUN pin low
- Setting SW-DP CDBGRSTREQ via SWD
- Setting RP-AP rescue reset via SWD
If a pad’s isolation latches are in the latched state (Section 9.7) then resetting the PADS and IO registers does not
physically return the pad to its reset state. The isolation latches prevent upstream signals from propagating to the pad.
Clear the ISO bit to allow signals to propagate.

## 9.4. Function select

```
To allocate a function to a GPIO, write to the FUNCSEL field in the CTRL register corresponding to the pin. For a list of GPIOs
and corresponding registers, see Table 645. For an example, see GPIO0_CTRL. The descriptions for the functions listed
in this table can be found in Table 646.
Each GPIO can only select one function at a time. Each peripheral input (e.g. UART0 RX) should only be selected by one
GPIO at a time. If you connect the same peripheral input to multiple GPIOs, the peripheral sees the logical OR of these
GPIO inputs.

Function Name Description
SIO Software control of GPIO, from the single-cycle IO (SIO) block. The SIO function (F5) must be selected
for the processors to drive a GPIO, but the input is always connected, so software can check the state
of GPIOs at any time.
QMI QSPI memory interface peripheral, used for execute-in-place from external QSPI flash or PSRAM
memory devices.
The six QSPI Bank GPIO pins are typically used by the XIP peripheral to communicate with an external flash device.
However, there are two scenarios where the pins can be used as software-controlled GPIOs:
```
- If a SPI or Dual-SPI flash device is used for execute-in-place, then the SD2 and SD3 pins are not used for flash
    access, and can be used for other GPIO functions on the circuit board.
- If RP2350 is used in a flashless configuration (USB and OTP boot only), then all six pins can be used for software-
    controlled GPIO functions.

## 9.5. Interrupts

```
An interrupt can be generated for every GPIO pin in four scenarios:
```
- Level High: the GPIO pin is a logical 1
- Level Low: the GPIO pin is a logical 0
- Edge High: the GPIO has transitioned from a logical 0 to a logical 1
- Edge Low: the GPIO has transitioned from a logical 1 to a logical 0
The level interrupts are not latched. This means that if the pin is a logical 1 and the level high interrupt is active, it will
become inactive as soon as the pin changes to a logical 0. The edge interrupts are stored in the INTR register and can be
cleared by writing to the INTR register.
There are enable, status, and force registers for three interrupt destinations: proc 0, proc 1, and dormant_wake. For proc
0 the registers are enable (PROC0_INTE0), status (PROC0_INTS0), and force (PROC0_INTF0). Dormant wake is used to
wake the ROSC or XOSC up from dormant mode. See Section 6.5.6.2 for more information on dormant mode.
There is an interrupt output for each combination of IO bank, IRQ destination, and security domain. In total there are
twelve such outputs:
- IO Bank 0 to dormant wake (Secure and Non-secure)
- IO Bank 0 to proc 0 (Secure and Non-secure)
- IO Bank 0 to proc 1 (Secure and Non-secure)
- IO QSPI to dormant wake (Secure and Non-secure)
- IO QSPI to proc 0 (Secure and Non-secure)
- IO QSPI to proc 1 (Secure and Non-secure)
Each interrupt output has its own array of enable registers (INTE) that configures which GPIO events cause the interrupt
to assert. The interrupt asserts when at least one enabled event occurs, and de-asserts when all enabled events have
been acknowledged via the relevant INTR register.
This means the user can watch for several GPIO events at once.
Summary registers can be used to quickly check for pending GPIO interrupts. See IRQSUMMARY_PROC0_NONSECURE
for an example.

9.5. Interrupts 594

## 9.6. Pads

####  CAUTION

```
Under certain conditions, pull-down does not function as expected. For more information, see RP2350-E9.
```
```
Each GPIO is connected off-chip via a pad. Pads are the electrical interface between the chip’s internal logic and
external circuitry. They translate signal voltage levels, support higher currents and offer some protection against
electrostatic discharge (ESD) events. You can adjust pad electrical behaviour to meet the requirements of external
circuitry in the following ways:
```
- Output drive strength can be set to 2mA, 4mA, 8mA or 12mA.
- Output slew rate can be set to slow or fast.
- Input hysteresis (Schmitt trigger mode) can be enabled.
- A pull-up or pull-down can be enabled, to set the output signal level when the output driver is disabled.
- The input buffer can be disabled, to reduce current consumption when the pad is unused, unconnected or
    connected to an analogue signal.
An example pad is shown in Figure 42.

Figure 42. Diagram ofa single IO pad.

```
The pad’s Output Enable, Output Data and Input Data ports connect, via the IO mux, to the function controlling the pad.
All other ports are controlled from the pad control register. You can use this register to disable the pad’s output driver by
overriding the Output Enable signal from the function controlling the pad. See GPIO0 for an example of a pad control
register.
Both the output signal level and acceptable input signal level at the pad are determined by the digital IO supply (IOVDD).
IOVDD can be any nominal voltage between 1.8V and 3.3V, but to meet specification when powered at 1.8V, the pad
input thresholds must be adjusted by writing a 1 to the pad VOLTAGE_SELECT registers. By default, the pad input thresholds
are valid for an IOVDD voltage between 2.5V and 3.3V. Using a voltage of 1.8V with the default input thresholds is a safe
operating mode, but it will result in input thresholds that don’t meet specification.
```
####  WARNING

```
Using IOVDD voltages greater than 1.8V, with the input thresholds set for 1.8V may result in damage to the chip.
```
```
Pad input threshold are adjusted on a per bank basis, with separate VOLTAGE_SELECT registers for the pads associated with
the User IO bank (IO Bank 0) and the QSPI IO bank. However, both banks share the same digital IO supply (IOVDD), so
both register should always be set to the same value.
Pad register details are available in Section 9.11.3, “Pad Control - User Bank” and Section 9.11.4, “Pad Control - QSPI
Bank”.
```
9.6. Pads 595

### 9.6.1. Bus keeper mode

```
For each pad, only the pull-up or the pull-down resistor can be enabled at any given time. It is impossible to enable both
simultaneously. Instead, if you set both the GPIO0.PDE and GPIO0.PUE bits simultaneously then you enable bus keeper
mode, where the pad is:
```
- Pulled up when its input is high.
- Pulled down when its input is low.
When the output buffer is disabled, and the pad is not driven by any external source, this mode weakly retains the pad’s
current logical state. The pad does not float to mid-rail.
Bus keeper mode relies on control logic in the switched core domain, so does not function when the core is powered
down. Rather, powering down the core when bus keeper mode is enabled latches the current output controls (pull-up or
pull-down) in the pad isolation latches, as described in Section 9.7.

## 9.7. Pad isolation latches

```
RP2350 features extended low-power states that allow all internal logic, with the exception of POWMAN and some
CoreSight debug logic, to fully power down under software control. This includes powering down all peripherals, the IO
muxing, and the pad control registers, which brings with it the risk that pad signals may experience unwanted
transitions when entering and exiting low-power states.
To ensure that pad states are well-defined at all times, all signals passing from the switched core power domain to the
pads pass through isolation latches. In normal operation, the latches are transparent, so the pads are controlled fully by
logic inside the switched core power domain, such as UARTs or the processors. However, when the ISO bit for each pad
is set (e.g. GPIO0.ISO) or the switched core domain is powered down, the control signals currently presented to that pad
are latched until the isolation is disabled. This includes the output enable state, output high/low level, and pull-up/pull-
down resistor enable. The input signal from the pad back into the switched core domain is not isolated.
Consequently, when switched core logic is powered down, all Bank 0 and Bank 1 pads maintain the output state they
held immediately before the power down, unless overridden by always-on logic in POWMAN. When the switched core
power domain powers back up, all the GPIO ISO bits reset to 1, so the pre-power down state continues to be maintained
until user software starts up and clears the ISO bit to indicate it is ready to use the pad again. Pads whose IO muxing
has not yet been set up can be left isolated indefinitely, and will maintain their pre-power down state.
when software has finished setting up the IO muxing for a given pad, and the peripheral that is to be muxed in, the ISO
bit should be cleared. At this point the isolation latches will become transparent again: output signals passing through
the IO muxing block are now reflected in the pad output state, so peripherals can communicate with the outside world.
This process allows the switched core domain to be power cycled without causing any transitions on the pad outputs
that may interfere with the operation of external hardware connected to the pads.
```
####  NOTE

```
Non-SDK applications ported from RP2040 must clear the ISO bit before using a GPIO, as this feature was not
present on RP2040. The SDK automatically clears the ISO bit when gpio_set_function() is called.
```
```
The isolation latches themselves are reset by the always-on power domain reset, namely any one of:
```
- Power-on reset
- Brownout reset
- RUN pin being asserted low
- SW-DP CDBGRSTREQ
- RP-AP rescue reset
The latches reset to the reset value of the signal being isolated. For example, on Bank 0 GPIOs, the input enable control

9.7. Pad isolation latches 596

```
(GPIO0.IE) resets to 0 (input-disabled), so the isolation latches for these signals also take a reset value of 0. Resetting
the isolation latch forces the pad to assume its reset state even if it is currently isolated.
The ISO control bits (e.g. GPIO0.ISO) are reset by the top-level switched core domain isolation signal, which is asserted
by POWMAN before powering down the switched core domain and de-asserted after it is powered up. This means that
entering and exiting a sleep state where the switched core domain is unpowered leaves all GPIOs isolated after power
up; you can then re-engage them individually. The ISO control bits are not reset by the PADS register block reset driven
by the RESETS control registers: resetting the PADS register block returns non-isolated pads to their reset state, but has
no effect on isolated pads.
```
## 9.8. Processor GPIO controls (SIO)

```
The single-cycle IO subsystem (Section 3.1) contains memory-mapped GPIO registers. The processors can use these to
perform input/output operations on GPIOs:
```
- The GPIO_OUT and GPIO_HI_OUT registers set the output level: 1 = high, 0 = low
- The GPIO_OE and GPIO_HI_OE registers set the output enable: 1 = output, 0 = input
- The GPIO_IN and GPIO_HI_IN registers read the GPIO inputs
These registers are all 32 bits in size. The low registers (e.g. GPIO_OUT) connect to GPIOs 0 through 31, and the high
registers (e.g. GPIO_HI_OUT) connect to GPIOs 32 through 47, the QSPI pads, and the USB DM/DP pads.
For the output and output enable registers to take effect, the SIO function must be selected on each GPIO (function 5 ).
However, the GPIO input registers read back the GPIO input values even when the SIO function is not selected, so the
processor can always check the input state of any pin.
The SIO GPIO registers are shared between the two processors and between the Secure and Non-secure security
domains. This avoids programming errors introduced by selecting multiple GPIO functions for access from different
contexts.
Non-secure code’s view of the SIO registers is restricted by the Non-secure GPIO mask defined in GPIO_NSMASK0 and
GPIO_NSMASK1. Non-secure writes to Secure GPIOs are ignored. Non-secure reads of Secure GPIOs return 0.
These registers are documented in more detail in the SIO GPIO register section (Section 3.1.3).
The DMA cannot access registers in the SIO subsystem. The recommended method to DMA to GPIOs is a PIO program
that continuously transfers TX FIFO data to the GPIO outputs, which provides more consistent timing than DMA directly
into GPIO registers.

## 9.9. GPIO coprocessor port

```
Coprocessor port 0 on each Cortex-M33 processor connects to a GPIO coprocessor interface. These coprocessor
instructions provide fast access to the SIO GPIO registers from Arm software:
```
- The equivalent of any SIO GPIO register access is a single instruction, without having to materialise a 32-bit
    register address beforehand
- An indexed write operation on any single GPIO is a single instruction
- 64 bits can be read/written in a single instruction
This reduces the timing impact of GPIO accesses on surrounding software, for example when GPIO tracing has been
added to interrupt handlers diagnose complex timing issues.
Both Secure and Non-secure code may access the coprocessor. Non-secure code sees a restricted view of the GPIO
registers, defined by ACCESSCTRL GPIO_NSMASK0/1.
The GPIO coprocessor instruction set is documented in Section 3.6.1.

## 9.10. Software examples

### 9.10.1. Select an IO function

```
An IO pin can perform many different functions and must be configured before use. For example, you may want it to be
a UART_TX pin, or a PWM output. The SDK provides gpio_set_function for this purpose. Many SDK examples call
gpio_set_function early on to enable printing to a UART.
The SDK starts by defining a structure to represent the registers of IO Bank 0, the User IO bank. Each IO has a status
register, followed by a control register. For N IOs, the SDK instantiates the structure containing a status and control
register as io[N] to repeat it N times.

A similar structure is defined for the pad control registers for IO bank 1. By default, all pads come out of reset ready to
use, with input enabled and output disable set to 0. Regardless, gpio_set_function in the SDK sets the input enable and
clears the output disable to engage the pad’s IO buffers and connect internal signals to the outside world. Finally, the
desired function select is written to the IO control register (see GPIO0_CTRL for an example of an IO control register).

### 9.10.2. Enable a GPIO interrupt

```
The SDK provides a method of being interrupted when a GPIO pin changes state:
SDK: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_gpio/gpio.c Lines 186 - 196
186 void gpio_set_irq_enabled(uint gpio, uint32_t events, bool enabled) {
187 // either this call disables the interrupt or callback should already be set.
188 // this protects against enabling the interrupt without callback set
189 assert(!enabled || irq_has_handler(IO_IRQ_BANK0));

gpio_set_irq_enabled uses a lower level function _gpio_set_irq_enabled:
SDK: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_gpio/gpio.c Lines 173 - 184
173 static void _gpio_set_irq_enabled(uint gpio, uint32_t events, bool enabled,
io_bank0_irq_ctrl_hw_t *irq_ctrl_base) {
174 // Clear stale events which might cause immediate spurious handler entry
175 gpio_acknowledge_irq(gpio, events);
176
177 io_rw_32 *en_reg = &irq_ctrl_base->inte[gpio / 8];
178 events <<= 4 * (gpio % 8);
179
180 if (enabled)
181 hw_set_bits(en_reg, events);
182 else
183 hw_clear_bits(en_reg, events);
184 }
```
```
The user provides a pointer to a callback function that is called when the GPIO event happens. An example application
that uses this system is hello_gpio_irq:
