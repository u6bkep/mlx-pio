## 6.1. Power supplies

```
RP2350 requires five separate power supplies. However, in most applications, several of these can be combined and
connected to a single power source. Typical applications only require a single 3.3 V supply. See Figure 19.
```
```
The power supplies and a number of potential power supply schemes are described in the following sections. Detailed
power supply parameters are provided in Section 14.9.5.
```
###### 6.1.1. Digital IO supply (IOVDD)

```
IOVDD provides the IO supply for the chip’s GPIO, and should be powered at a nominal voltage between 1.8 V and 3.3 V.
The supply voltage sets the external signal level for the digital IO, and should be chosen based on the level required, see
Section 14.9 for details. All GPIOs share the same power supply and operate at the same signal level.
If the digital IO is powered at a nominal 1.8 V, the IO input thresholds should be adjusted by setting the
VOLTAGE_SELECT register to 1. VOLTAGE_SELECT is set to 0 by default, which results in input thresholds that are valid
for a nominal IO voltage between 2.5 V and 3.3 V. See Chapter 9 for details.
```
 CAUTION

```
Powering the IOVDD at 1.8 V with input thresholds set for a 2.5 V to 3.3 V supply is a safe operating mode, but will
result in input thresholds that do not meet specification. Powering the IO at voltages greater than 1.8 V with input
thresholds set for a 1.8 V supply may result in damage to the chip.
```
###### 6.1.2. QSPI IO supply (QSPI_IOVDD)

```
QSPI_IOVDD provides the IO supply for the chip’s QSPI interface, and should be powered at a nominal voltage between
1.8 V and 3.3 V. The supply voltage sets the external signal level for the QSPI interface, and should be chosen based on
the level required, see Section 14.9 for details. In most applications the QSPI interface will be connected to an external
flash device, which will determine the required signal level.
```
```
If the QSPI interface is powered at a nominal 1.8 V, the IO input thresholds should be adjusted by setting the
VOLTAGE_SELECT register to 1. VOLTAGE_SELECT is set to 0 by default, which results in input thresholds that are valid
for a nominal IO voltage between 2.5 V and 3.3 V. See Chapter 9 for details.
```
 (^) CAUTION
Powering the IOVDD at 1.8 V with input thresholds set for a 2.5 V to 3.3 V supply is a safe operating mode, but will
result in input thresholds that do not meet specification. Powering the IO at voltages greater than 1.8 V with input
thresholds set for a 1.8 V supply may result in damage to the chip.

###### 6.1.3. Digital core supply (DVDD)

```
The chip’s core digital logic is powered by DVDD, which should be at a nominal 1.1 V. A dedicated on-chip core voltage
regulator allows DVDD to be generated from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V input supply. See Section 6.3 for details. Alternatively, DVDD
can be supplied directly from an off-chip power source.
```
```
If the on-chip core voltage regulator is used, the two DVDD pins closest to the regulator should be decoupled with a 100nF
capacitor close to the pins. The DVDD pin furthest from the regulator should be decoupled with a 4.7μF capacitor close to
```
6.1. Power supplies 441

```
the pin.
```
###### 6.1.4. USB PHY and OTP supply (USB_OTP_VDD)

```
USB_OTP_VDD supplies the chip’s USB PHY and OTP memory, and should be powered at a nominal 3.3 V. To reduce the
number of external power supplies, USB_OTP_VDD can use the same power source as the core voltage regulator analogue
supply (VREG_AVDD), or digital IO supply (IOVDD), assuming IOVDD is also powered at 3.3 V. This supply must always be
provided, even in applications where the USB PHY is never used.
USB_OTP_VDD should be decoupled with a 100nF capacitor close to the chip’s USB_OTP_VDD pin.
```
###### 6.1.5. ADC supply (ADC_AVDD)

```
ADC_AVDD supplies the chip’s Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC). It can be powered at a nominal voltage between 1.8 V
and 3.3 V, but the performance of the ADC will be compromised at voltages below 2.97 V. To reduce the number of
external power supplies, ADC_AVDD can use the same power source as the core voltage regulator analogue supply
(VREG_AVDD) or digital IO supply (IOVDD).
```
 NOTE

```
It is safe to supply ADC_AVDD at a higher or lower voltage than IOVDD, e.g. to power the ADC at 3.3 V, for optimum
performance, while supporting 1.8 V signal levels on the digital IO. But the voltage on the ADC analogue inputs must
not exceed IOVDD, e.g. if IOVDD is powered at 1.8 V, the voltage on the ADC inputs should be limited to 1.8 V. Voltages
greater than IOVDD will result in leakage currents through the ESD protection diodes. See Section 14.9 for details.
```
```
ADC_AVDD should be decoupled with a 100nF capacitor close to the chip’s ADC_AVDD pin.
```
###### 6.1.6. Core voltage regulator input supply (VREG_VIN)

```
VREG_VIN is the input supply for the on-chip core voltage regulator, and should be in the range 2.7 V to 5.5 V. To reduce
the number of external power supplies, VREG_VIN can use the same power source as the voltage regulator analogue
supply (VREG_AVDD), or digital IO supply (IOVDD). Though care should be taken to minimise the noise on VREG_AVDD.
A 4.7μF capacitor should be connected between VREG_VIN and ground close to the chip’s VREG_VIN pin.
```
```
For more details on the on-chip voltage regulator see Section 6.3.
```
###### 6.1.7. On-chip voltage regulator analogue supply (VREG_AVDD)

```
VREG_AVDD supplies the on chip voltage regulator’s analogue control circuits, and should be powered at a nominal 3.3 V.
To reduce the number of external power supplies, VREG_AVDD can use the same power source as the voltage regulator
input supply (VREG_VIN), or the digital IO supply (IOVDD). Though care should be taken to minimise the noise on VREG_AVDD.
A passive low pass filter may be required, see Section 6.3.7 for details.
```
 NOTE

```
VREG_AVDD also powers the chip’s power-on reset and brownout detection blocks, so it must be powered even if the
on-chip voltage regulator is not used.
```
6.1. Power supplies 442

###### 6.1.8. Power supply sequencing

```
With the exception of the two voltage regulator supplies (VREG_VIN and VREG_AVDD), which should be powered up together,
RP2350’s power supplies may be powered up or down in any order. However, small transient currents may flow in the
ADC supply (ADC_AVDD) if it is powered up before, or powered down after, the digital core supply (DVDD). This will not
damage the chip, but can be avoided by powering up DVDD before or at the same time as ADC_AVDD, and powering down
DVDD after or at the same time as ADC_AVDD. In the most common power supply scheme, where the chip is powered from
a single 3.3 V supply, DVDD will be powered up shortly after ADC_AVDD due to the startup time of the on-chip voltage
regulator. This is acceptable behaviour.
```
## 6.2. Power management

```
RP2350 retains the power control features of RP2040, but extends them by splitting the chip’s digital core into a number
of power domains, which can be selectively powered off. This allows significant power saving in applications where the
chip is not continuously active. This section describes the core power domains and how they are controlled. The legacy
RP2040 power control features still offer useful power savings, and are described in Section 6.5.
Power domains, and transitions between power states, are controlled by a Power manager. The Power manager runs
from either an internal low power oscillator lposc, or the reference clock clk_ref. The device may be configured to power
down under software control and can wakeup on a GPIO or timer event. Configuration of the power manager is via the
POWMAN registers in Section 6..
```
###### 6.2.1. Core power domains

```
RP2350’s core logic is divided into five power domains. With some restrictions, these domains can be selectively
powered off to reduce the chip’s power consumption. The five domains are:
```
- AON^ - Always On - a small amount of logic that is always powered on when chip’s core supply (DVDD) is available
- SWCORE^ - Switched Core - the remaining core logic functions, including processors, bus fabric, peripherals, etc.
- XIP^ - XIP cache SRAM and Boot RAM
- SRAM0^ - SRAM Power Domain 0 - the lower half of the large SRAM banks
- SRAM1^ - SRAM Power Domain 1 - the upper half of the large SRAM banks, and the scratch SRAMs
Logic in the AON domain controls the power state of the other power domains, which can be powered on or off
independently. The only exception is the XIP domain, which must always be powered when the SWCORE domain is
powered. SRAMs that are powered on retain their contents when the switched core is powered off.
Figure 18 gives an overview of the core power domains.

###### 6.2.2. Power states

```
RP2350 can operate in a number of power states, depending on which domains are powered on or off. Power states
have names in the form Pc.m where:
```
- c^ indicates the state of the switched core (SWCORE) domain:^0 = on /^1 = off
- m^ is a 3 bit binary representation of the memory power domains, in the order XIP, SRAM0, SRAM
P0.m states, where the switched core is powered on, are Normal Operating states. P1.m states, where the switched core is
powered off, are Low Power states
Table 475 shows the available power states.

```
```
P1.7 Low Power (XIP & SRAM0 & SRAM1 off) on off off off off
```
```
OFF Not Powered off off off off off
```
```
In the OFF state, the chip has no external power and all domains are unpowered. The chip moves from OFF to P0.
automatically as soon as external power is applied.
To determine the current power state, read the STATE.CURRENT field. CURRENT is a 4 bit field representing the power
state of the switched core and memory power domains.
```
###### 6.2.3. Power state transitions

```
Transitions between power states can be initiated by software, hardware, or via the chip’s debug subsystem. After
initiation, transitions are managed by autonomous power sequencers in the chip’s AON power domain. The power
sequencers can be configured, in a limited way, via the SEQ_CFG register. The sequencers can also be observed and
controlled, again in a limited way, via the RP-AP registers in the chip’s debug subsystem. These registers are described
in Section 3.5.10.
```
```
Valid power state transitions are as follows:
```
- all transitions from one^ P0.m^ state (switched core powered on) to another^ P0.m^ state (switched core powered on), if
    they increase or decrease the number of SRAM domains that are powered on
- all transitions from a^ P0.m^ state (switched core powered on) to a^ P1.m^ state (switched core powered off), except
    transitions that would result in a powered off SRAM domain becoming powered on
- all transitions from a^ P1.m^ state (switched core powered off) to a^ P0.m^ state (switched core powered on), except
    transitions that would result in a powered on SRAM domain becoming powered off
Transitions from one P1.m state (switched core powered off) to another P1.m state (switched core powered off) are not
supported, and will be prevented by the hardware.
Valid transitions are shown in the table below.

6.2.3.1. Transitions from Normal Operating (P0.m) states

```
Transitions from a Normal Operating (P0.m) state to either a Low Power (P1.m) state, or another Normal Operating (P0.m)
state, are initiated by writing to the STATE.REQ field. REQ is a 4-bit field representing the requested power state of the
switched core and memory power domains. The STATE.WAITING field will be set immediately, followed by the the
STATE.CHANGING field, after the actual state change starts. If a transition to a Low Power (P1.m) state is requested,
WAITING will remain set until the processors have gone into a low power state (via __wfi()). In the WAITING state, writing to
the STATE.REQ field can change or cancel the initial request. The requested state can’t be changed when in the CHANGING
state.
A request to move to an unsupported state, or a state that would result in an invalid transition, causes the
STATE.BAD_SW_REQ field to be set.
If a hardware power up request is received while in the WAITING state, the transition requested via STATE.REQ will be
halted and the power up request completed. The STATE.PWRUP_WHILE_WAITING and STATE.REQ_IGNORED fields will
be set.
On writing to STATE.REQ:
```
- If there is a pending power up request, STATE.REQ_IGNORED is set and no further action is taken
- If the requested state is invalid, STATE.BAD_SW_REQ is set and no further action is taken
- If the switched core is being powered off, STATE.WAITING is set until both processors enter^ __wfi(). After which
    STATE.CHANGING will be set, but no processors will be powered up to read the flag at this time

#### ◦ If there is a power up request while in STATE.WAITING, STATE.PWRUP_WHILE_WAITING is set, which can

```
also raise an interrupt to bring the processors out of __wfi(). No further action is taken
```
#### ◦ You can get out of the^ WAITING^ state by writing a new request to STATE.REQ before both processors have gone

```
into __wfi()
```
- Any state request that isn’t powering down the switched core, such as powering up or down SRAM domain 0 or 1
    starts immediately. Software should wait until STATE.CHANGING has cleared to know the power down sequence.
    After the STATE.CHANGING flag is cleared STATE.CURRENT is updated.
- If powering up, software should also wait for STATE.CHANGING to make sure everything is powered up before
    continuing. In practice this is handled by the RP2350 bootrom.
Invalid state transitions are:
- any combination of power up and power down requests
- any request which would result in power down of XIP/bootRAM and power up of SWCORE
If XIP, boot RAM, sram0, or sram1 remain powered while SWCORE is powered off, the sram will automatically switch to
a low power state. Stored data will be retained.
Before transitioning to a switched-core power down state (P1.m), software needs to configure:
- the GPIO wakeup conditions if required
- the wakeup alarm if required
- the return state of the SRAM0 & SRAM1 domains

6.2. Power management 446

6.2.3.2. Transitions from Low Power (P1.m) states

```
Transitions from P1.m to P0.m states are initiated by GPIO events or the timer alarm.
There are up to 5 wakeup sources:
```
- up to 4 GPIO wakeups (level high/low or falling edge/rising edge)
- 1 alarm wakeup
GPIO wakeups are configured by the PWRUP0-PWRUP3 registers. The wakeups are not enabled until the power
sequencer completes the power down operation.
The alarm wakeup is configured by writing to the ALARM_TIME_15TO0-ALARM_TIME_63TO48 registers. The alarm
wakeup has a resolution of 1ms. Once set, the alarm wakeup is armed by writing a 1 to both TIMER.PWRUP_ON_ALARM
and TIMER.ALARM_ENAB. If the alarm fires during the power down sequence, a power up sequence will start when the
power down sequence completes.
The LAST_SWCORE_PWRUP register indicates which event caused the most recent power up.

6.2.3.3. Debugger-initiated power state transitions

```
The debugger can be used to trigger a power up sequence via the CSYSPWRUPREQ output from the SW-DP CTRL/STAT register.
This powers all domains (i.e. returns to state P0.0) and also inhibits any further software initiated power state
transitions.
When CSYSPWRUPREQ is asserted, the power sequencer will:
```
- complete any power state transitions that are in progress
- return to power state^ P0.
- assert^ CSYSPWRUPACK^ to signal completion to the debug host
If CSYSPWRUPREQ is de-asserted then software initiated power transitions will be able to resume. The user can detect when
a software requested transition is ignored because of CSYSPWRUPREQ using the following hints:
- Getting a STATE.REQ_IGNORED after a write to STATE.REQ
- CURRENT_PWRUP_REQ will have bit 5 (coresight) set
- Either:

#### ◦ Get the debugger to de-assert^ CSYSPWRUPREQ^ or

#### ◦ Mask out^ CSYSPWRUPREQ^ by setting DBG_PWRCFG.IGNORE

 NOTE

```
DBG_PWRCFG.IGNOREis useful to test going to sleep with a debugger attached or ignoring CSYSPWRUPREQ. A debugger
will likely leave CSYSPWRUPREQ set when disconnecting. It would be impossible to go to sleep after this without
DBG_PWRCFG.IGNORE.
```
6.2.3.4. Power-mode-aware GPIO control

```
The power manager sequencer is able to switch the state of two GPIO outputs on entry to and exit from a P1.m state, i.e.
one where the switched core is powered down. This allows external devices to be power-aware. The GPIOs switch to
indicate the low power state after the core is powered down and switch to indicate the high power state before the core
is powered up. This ensures the high power state of the external components always overlaps the high power state of
the core. The GPIOs are configured by the EXT_CTRL0 and EXT_CTRL1 registers.
```
6.2. Power management 447

6.2.3.5. Isolation

```
When powering down SWCORE, the pad control and data signals are latched and isolated from the IO logic. This avoids
transitions on pads which could potentially corrupt external components. On SWCORE power up, the isolation is not
released automatically. The user releases the isolation by clearing the ISO field of the pad control register (for example
GPIO0.ISO) after the IO logic has been configured.
```
## 6.3. Core voltage regulator

```
RP2350 provides an on-chip voltage regulator for its digital core supply (DVDD). The regulator requires a 2.7 V to 5.5 V
input supply (VREG_VIN), allowing DVDD to be generated directly from a single lithium ion cell, or a USB power supply. A
separate, nominally 3.3 V, low noise supply (VREG_AVDD) is required for the regulator’s analogue control circuits. The
regulator supports both switching and linear modes of regulation, allowing efficient operation at both high and low
loads.
To allow the chip to start up, the regulator is enabled by default, and will power up as soon as its supplies are available.
The regulator starts in switching mode, with a nominal 1.1 V output, but its operating mode and output voltage can be
changed once the chip is out of reset. The output voltage can be set in the range 0.55 V to 3.30 V, and the regulator can
supply up to 200mA.
```
```
Although intended for the chip’s digital core supply (DVDD), the regulator can be used for other purposes if DVDD is
powered directly from an external power supply.
```
###### 6.3.1. Operating modes

```
The regulator has the following three modes of operation.
```
6.3.1.1. Normal mode

```
In normal mode, the regulator operates in a switching mode, and can supply up to 200mA. Normal mode is used for P0.x
power states, when the chip’s switched core is powered on. The regulator must be in normal mode before the core
supply current is allowed to exceed 1mA. The regulator starts up in normal mode when its input supplies are first
applied.
```
6.3.1.2. Low-power mode

```
In low-power mode, the regulator operates in a linear mode, and can only supply up to 1mA. Low-power mode can be
used for P1.x power states, where the chip’s switched core is powered off. The core supply current must be less than
1mA before the regulator is moved to low-power mode. The regulator’s output voltage is limited to 1.3 V in low-power
mode.
```
 (^) CAUTION
In low-power mode, the output of the regulator is directly connected to DVDD. It isn’t possible to disconnect the
regulator from DVDD in this mode. Don’t put the regulator into low-power mode if DVDD is being powered from an
external supply.
6.3.1.3. High-impedance mode
In high-impedance mode, the regulator is disabled, its power consumption is minimised, and its outputs are set to a
high-impedance state. This mode should only be used if the digital core supply (DVDD) is provided by an external
6.3. Core voltage regulator 448

```
regulator. If the on-chip regulator is supplying DVDD, entering high-impedance mode causes a reset event, returning the
on-chip regulator to Normal mode.
```
###### 6.3.2. Software control

 (^) WARNING
The regulator can’t be relocked after it’s been unlocked. Avoid accidental writes to the VREG register.
The regulator can be directly controlled by software, but must first be unlocked by writing a 1 to the UNLOCK field in the
VREG_CTRL register. Once unlocked, the regulator can be controlled via the VREG register.
The regulator’s operating mode defaults to Normal, at initial power up or after a reset event, but can be switched to high
impedance by writing a 1 to the VREG register’s HIZ field. The regulator’s output voltage can be set by writing to the
register’s VSEL field, see the VREG register description for details on available settings. To prevent accidental over-
voltage, the output voltage is limited to 1.3 V unless the DISABLE_VOLTAGE_LIMIT field in the VREG_CTRL is set. The output
voltage defaults to 1.1 V at initial power-on or after a reset event.
The UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS field in the VREG register is set while the regulator’s operating mode or output voltage are being
updated. When UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS is set, writes to the register are ignored.
It isn’t possible to place the regulator in low-power mode under software control because the load current will exceed
1mA when software is running.
 CAUTION
The regulator’s output voltage can be varied between 0.55 V and 3.3 V, but RP2350 might not operate reliably with
its digital core supply (DVDD) at a voltage other than 1.1 V.

###### 6.3.3. Power Manager control

```
The regulator’s operating mode and output voltage can also be controlled by the Power Manager. Power Manager
control is typically used when the chip enters or exits a low-power (P1.x) state, when software might not be running.
```
```
In addition to normal and high-impedance modes, Power Manager control allows the regulator to be placed in low-
power mode. By default, the regulator switches to low-power mode when entering a low-power (P1.x) state, and returns
to Normal mode when returning to a normal (P0.x) state.
The operating mode and output voltage in the low-power state are set by the values in the VREG_LP_ENTRY register.
And the operating mode and output voltage to be used when the chip has returned to a normal state are set by values in
the VREG_LP_EXIT register. The registers contain an additional MODE field that allows low-power mode to be selected.
The values in the registers must be written by software before requesting a transition to a low-power state because
software won’t be running during or after the transition. The actual transitions to and from the low-power state are
handled by the Power Manager. Once the chip has returned to a normal state, software can be run and the regulator
controlled directly. The values in the VREG register reflect the regulator’s current operating mode and output voltage
once the chip has returned to a normal state.
```
6.3. Core voltage regulator 449

 CAUTION

```
Low-power mode should only be used when the regulator is providing the chip’s digital core supply (DVDD) because
the regulator’s low-power output is connected to DVDD on chip.
```
###### 6.3.4. Status

```
To determine the status of the regulator, read the VREG_STS register, which contains two fields:
```
- VOUT_OK^ indicates whether the voltage regulator’s output is being correctly regulated. At power-on,^ VOUT_OK^ remains
    low until the regulator has started up and the output voltage reaches the VOUT_OK assertion threshold (VOUT_OKTH.ASSERT).
    It then remains high until the voltage drops below the VOUT_OK de-assertion threshold (VOUT_OKTH.DEASSERT), remaining low
    until the output voltage is above the assertion threshold again. VOUT_OKTH.ASSERT is nominally 90% of the selected output
    voltage, 0.99 V if the selected output voltage is 1.1 V, and VOUT_OKTH.DEASSERT is nominally 87% of the selected output
    voltage, 0.957 V if the selected output voltage is 1.1 V. See Section 14.9.6 for details.
- STARTUP^ is high when the regulator is starting up, and remains high until the regulator’s operating mode or output
    voltage are changed, either by software or the Power Manager
Adjusting the output voltage to a higher voltage will cause VOUT_OK to go low until the assertion threshold for the higher
voltage is reached. VOUT_OK will also go low if the regulator is placed in high-impedance mode.

###### 6.3.5. Current limit

```
The voltage regulator includes a current limit to prevent the load current exceeding the maximum rated value. The
output voltage won’t be regulated and will drop below the selected value when the current limit is active. See Section
14.9.6 for details.
```
###### 6.3.6. Over temperature protection

```
The voltage regulator will terminate regulation and disable its power transistors, if the transistor junction temperature
rises above a threshold set by the HT_TH field in the VREG_CTRL register. The regulator will restart regulation when the
transistor junction temperature drops to approximately 20°C below the temperature threshold.
```
###### 6.3.7. Application circuit

```
The regulator requires two external power supplies, the input supply (VREG_VIN), and a separate low noise supply for its
analogue control circuits (VREG_AVDD). VREG_VIN must be in the range 2.7 V to 5.5 V, and VREG_AVDD must be in the range
3.135 V to 3.63 V.
If VREG_VIN is limited to the range 3.135 V to 3.63 V, a single combined supply can be used for both VREG_VIN and
VREG_AVDD. This approach is shown in Figure 19. Take care to minimise noise on VREG_AVDD.

If the digital core supply (DVDD) is powered from an external 1.1V supply, the on-chip regulator can be disabled and the
application circuit simplified. Power must still be provided on the regulator’s analogue supply (VREG_AVDD) and input
supply (VREG_VIN) to power the chip’s power-on reset and brown-out detection blocks. But the inductor can be omitted
and only a single input capacitor is required. Connect VREG_FB directly to ground. This is shown in Figure 21.

The on-chip regulator will still power on as soon as VREG_VIN and VREG_AVDD are available, but can be shut down under
software control after the chip is out of reset. This is a safe mode of operation, though the regulator will consume
approximately 400 μA until it’s shut down. The regulator should be shut down by writing a 1 to the VREG register’s HIZ
field.

###### 6.3.8. External components and PCB layout requirements

```
The most critical part of an RP2350 PCB layout is the core voltage regulator. This should be placed first on any board
design and these guidelines must be strictly followed.

Designers should follow the above schematic Figure 22 and layout Figure 23 as closely as possible as this has had the
most verification and is considered our best practice layout. This circuit design is present on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2
and RP2350 reference design (see Hardware design with RP2350, Minimal Design Example) and both of these designs
are made available in either Cadence Allegro or Kicad formats respectively. Figure 23 shows the regulator layout on the
top layer of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 PCB. The bottom layer under the regulator is a ground plane that connects to the
QFN GND central pad.
```
6.3.8.1. Layout recommendations

- VREG_AVDD^ is a noise sensitive signal and must be RC filtered as per Figure 22.

#### ◦ Avoid doing anything that might couple noise into^ VREG_AVDD.

#### ◦ CIN^ needs its own separate GND via / low impedance path back to the RP2350 GND pad.

- The red and green arrows in Figure 23 show the high current paths for each of the regulator’s switching phases. It
    is critical keep the loop area of these current paths as small and low-impedance as possible, while also keeping
    them isolated (i.e. only connect to main GND at one point).

#### ◦ Follow this layout as closely as possibly.

#### ◦ Don’t place any of CIN/LX/COUT^ on the opposite side of the PCB.

- Reduce parasitics on the^ VREG_LX^ node.
- On the top layer make sure to cut away any extra copper underneath the inductor, cut back copper near the^ VREG_LX
    trace where possible.

6.3. Core voltage regulator 454

#### ◦ For a multi-layer board (4 or more layers) please cut away any copper immediately underneath LX/VREG_LX

```
node. For example, Figure 24 illustrates this.
```
- The GND via placement is critical.

#### ◦ There must be a short-as-possible, low impedance GND path back to the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 QFN GND pad

```
from the high-current GND at one single point (using 2 adjacent vias to reduce the impedance).
```
#### ◦ CFILT^ must also have a low impedance and short-as-possible path back to the QFN GND pad (don’t share any

```
GND vias with the CIN/COUT high current GND).
```
- The VREG_FB pin should be fed from the output of COUT, avoiding routing directly underneath LX.
- COUT is critical for regulator performance and EMI. It must be placed between^ VREG_VIN^ and^ VREG_PGND^ as close to the
    pins as practically possible.

#### ◦ In addition to COUT, for best performance we recommend a second 4.7μF capacitor is used on the VOUT^ net,

```
located on the bottom edge of the package (DVDD pin 23 on the QFN-60). Don’t place this near LX/COUT.
```
##### Layer 2

beneath LX/VREG_LX
net on layer 2 of 4 (or
more) layer PCBs

6.3.8.2. Component values

- CIN should be at least 4.7μF and have a maximum parasitic resistance of 50mΩ.
- COUT^ must be 4.7μF ±20% with a maximum parasitic resistance of 250mΩ^ and a maximum inductance of 6nH.
- LX^ must be fully shielded, 3.3μH ±20% and with a maximum DC resistance of 250mΩ. Saturation current should be
    at least 1.5A. The inductor must be marked for polarity (see Figure 25) and placed on the layout as indicated in
    Figure 23. As discussed below, we recommend the AOTA-B201610S3R3-101-T.

6.3. Core voltage regulator 455

6.3.8.3. Regulator sensitivities

```
The RP2350 regulator has a few sensitivities:
```
- The^ VREG_AVDD^ supply is noise sensitive.
- Efficiency is quite sensitive to inductance roll-off with inductor current, so an inductor with low roll-off is required
    for best operation (generally the higher saturation current the better).
- Even with nominally fully shielded inductors, leakage magnetic field coupling into the loop formed by the output
    VREG_LX node through the inductor and output capacitor (COUT) seems to affect the regulator control loop and output
    voltage. Field orientation (and hence inductor orientation) matters - the inductor has to be the right way around to
    make sure the regulator operates properly especially at higher output currents and for higher load transients. This
    necessitates an inductor with marked polarity.

```
To meet the above requirements, Raspberry Pi have worked with Abracon to create a custom 2.0×1.6mm 3.3μH polarity-
marked inductor, part number AOTA-B201610S3R3-101-T (see Figure 25 and Figure 25). These will be available in
general distribution in time, but for now please contact Raspberry Pi to request samples / production volumes.
```
```
Raspberry Pi is still working with the regulator IP vendor to fully verify and qualify the regulator and custom inductor.

###### 6.3.9. List of registers

```
The voltage regulator shares a register address space with other power management subsystems in the always-on
domain. This address space is referred to as POWMAN elsewhere in this document, and a complete list of POWMAN registers is
provided in Section 6.4. For reference information on POWMAN registers associated with the voltage regulator is repeated
here.
```
```
The POWMAN registers start at a base address of 0x40100000 (defined as POWMAN_BASE in the SDK).
```
- VREG_CTRL
- VREG_STS
- VREG
- VREG_LP_ENTRY
- VREG_LP_EXIT

## 6.4. Power management (POWMAN) registers

```
Password-protected POWMAN registers require a password (0x5AFE) to be written to the top 16 bits to enable the write
operation. This protects against accidental writes that could crash the chip untraceably. Writes to protected registers
that don’t include the password are ignored, setting a flag in the BADPASSWD register. Reads from protected registers
don’t return the password, to protect against erroneous read-modify-write operations.
Protected registers obviously don’t have writeable fields in the top 16 bits, however they may have read-only fields in
that range.
All registers with address offsets up to and including 0x000000ac are password protected. Therefore, the following
writeable registers are unprotected and have 32-bit write access:
```

0x30 WDSEL Allows a watchdog reset to reset the internal state of powman in
addition to the power-on state machine (PSM).
Note that powman ignores watchdog resets that do not select at
least the CLOCKS stage or earlier stages in the PSM. If using
these bits, it’s recommended to set PSM_WDSEL to all-ones in
addition to the desired bits in this register. Failing to select
CLOCKS or earlier will result in the POWMAN_WDSEL register
having no effect.

0x38 STATE This register controls the power state of the 4 power domains.
The current power state is indicated in
POWMAN_STATE_CURRENT which is read-only.
To change the state, write to POWMAN_STATE_REQ.
The coding of POWMAN_STATE_CURRENT &
POWMAN_STATE_REQ corresponds to the power states
defined in the datasheet:
bit 3 = SWCORE
bit 2 = XIP cache
bit 1 = SRAM
bit 0 = SRAM
0 = powered up
1 = powered down
When POWMAN_STATE_REQ is written, the
POWMAN_STATE_WAITING flag is set while the Power Manager
determines what is required. If an invalid transition is requested
the Power Manager will still register the request in
POWMAN_STATE_REQ but will also set the POWMAN_BAD_REQ
flag. It will then implement the power-up requests and ignore the
power down requests. To do nothing would risk entering an
unrecoverable lock-up state. Invalid requests are: any
combination of power up and power down requests any request
that results in swcore being powered and xip unpowered If the
request is to power down the switched-core domain then
POWMAN_STATE_WAITING stays active until the processors
halt. During this time the POWMAN_STATE_REQ field can be re-
written to change or cancel the request. When the power state
transition begins the POWMAN_STATE_WAITING_flag is cleared,
the POWMAN_STATE_CHANGING flag is set and POWMAN
register writes are ignored until the transition completes.

Allows a watchdog reset to reset the internal state of powman in addition to the power-on state machine (PSM).
Note that powman ignores watchdog resets that do not select at least the CLOCKS stage or earlier stages in the
PSM. If using these bits, it’s recommended to set PSM_WDSEL to all-ones in addition to the desired bits in this
register. Failing to select CLOCKS or earlier will result in the POWMAN_WDSEL register having no effect.

###### POWMAN: STATE Register

```
Offset: 0x38
Description
This register controls the power state of the 4 power domains.
The current power state is indicated in POWMAN_STATE_CURRENT which is read-only.
To change the state, write to POWMAN_STATE_REQ.
The coding of POWMAN_STATE_CURRENT & POWMAN_STATE_REQ corresponds to the power states
defined in the datasheet:
bit 3 = SWCORE
bit 2 = XIP cache
bit 1 = SRAM0
bit 0 = SRAM1
0 = powered up
1 = powered down
When POWMAN_STATE_REQ is written, the POWMAN_STATE_WAITING flag is set while the Power Manager
determines what is required. If an invalid transition is requested the Power Manager will still register the request in
POWMAN_STATE_REQ but will also set the POWMAN_BAD_REQ flag. It will then implement the power-up requests
and ignore the power down requests. To do nothing would risk entering an unrecoverable lock-up state. Invalid
requests are: any combination of power up and power down requests any request that results in swcore being
powered and xip unpowered If the request is to power down the switched-core domain then
POWMAN_STATE_WAITING stays active until the processors halt. During this time the POWMAN_STATE_REQ field
can be re-written to change or cancel the request. When the power state transition begins the
POWMAN_STATE_WAITING_flag is cleared, the POWMAN_STATE_CHANGING flag is set and POWMAN register
writes are ignored until the transition completes.

The BOOTDIS_NEXT bit is OR’d into the BOOTDIS_NOW bit when the core is
powered down. Simultaneously, the BOOTDIS_NEXT bit is cleared. Setting this
bit means that the BOOT0..3 registers will be ignored following the next reset
of the RSM by powman.

## 6.5. Power reduction strategies

```
RP2350 retains the SLEEP and DORMANT states for dynamic power control from RP2040. It extends these states by
introducing power domains (Section 6.2.1), which allow power to be removed from various components on chip,
virtually eliminating the leakage currents, and allowing lower power modes to be supported.
```
6.5. Power reduction strategies 488

###### 6.5.1. Top-level clock gates

```
Each clock domain (for example, the system clock) may drive a large number of distinct hardware blocks, not all of
which might be required at once. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation, each individual endpoint of each clock (for
example, the UART system clock input) may be disabled at any time.
Enabling and disabling a clock gate is glitch-free. If a peripheral clock is temporarily disabled, and subsequently re-
enabled, the peripheral will be in the same state as prior to the clock being disabled. No reset or reinitialisation should
be required.
Clock gates are controlled by two sets of registers: the WAKE_ENx registers (starting at WAKE_EN0) and SLEEP_ENx registers
(starting at SLEEP_EN0). These two sets of registers are identical at the bit level, each possessing a flag to control each
clock endpoint. The WAKE_EN registers specify which clocks are enabled whilst the system is awake, and the SLEEP_ENx
registers select which clocks are enabled while the processor is in the SLEEP state (Section 6.5.2).
The two processors do not have externally-controllable clock gates. Instead, the processors gate the clocks of their
subsystems autonomously, based on execution of WFI/WFE instructions, and external Event and IRQ signals.
```
###### 6.5.2. SLEEP state

```
RP2350 enters the SLEEP state when all of the following are true:
```
- Both processors are asleep (e.g. in a^ WFE^ or^ WFI^ instruction)
- The system DMA has no outstanding transfers on any channel
RP2350 exits the SLEEP state when either processor is awoken by an interrupt.
When in the SLEEP state, the top-level clock gates are masked by the SLEEP_ENx registers (starting at SLEEP_EN0), rather
than the WAKE_ENx registers (starting at WAKE_EN0). This permits more aggressive pruning of the clock tree when the
processors are asleep.

 (^) NOTE
Though it is possible for a clock to be enabled during SLEEP and disabled outside of SLEEP, this is generally not
useful.
For example, if the system is sleeping until a character interrupt from a UART, the entire system except for the UART
can be clock-gated (SLEEP_ENx = all-zeroes except for CLK_SYS_UART0 and CLK_PERI_UART0). This includes system
infrastructure such as the bus fabric.
When the UART asserts its interrupt and wakes a processor, RP2350 leaves SLEEP mode and switches back to the
WAKE_ENx clock mask. At the minimum, this should include the bus fabric and the memory devices containing the
processor’s stack and interrupt vectors.
A system-level clock request handshake holds the processors off the bus until the clocks are re-enabled.

###### 6.5.3. DORMANT state

```
The DORMANT state is a true zero-dynamic-power sleep state, where all clocks (and all oscillators) are disabled. The
system can awake from the DORMANT state upon a GPIO event (high/low level or rising/falling edge), or an AON Timer
alarm: this restarts one of the oscillators (either ring oscillator or crystal oscillator) and ungates the oscillator output
after it is stable. System state is retained, so code execution resumes immediately upon leaving the DORMANT state.
```
```
If relying on the AON Timer (Section 12.10) to wake from the DORMANT state, the AON Timer must run from the LPOSC
or an external clock source. The AON Timer accepts clock frequencies as low as 1Hz.
```
```
DORMANT does not halt PLLs. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation, software should power down PLLs before
entering the DORMANT state, and power up and reconfigure the PLLs again after exiting.
```
6.5. Power reduction strategies 489

```
If you halt the crystal oscillator (XOSC), you must also halt the PLLs to prevent them losing lock when their input
reference clock stops. The PLL VCO may behave erratically when the frequency reference is lost, such as increasing to
a very high frequency. Reconfigure and re-enable the PLLs after the XOSC starts again. Do not attempt to run clocks
from the PLLs while the XOSC is stopped.
The DORMANT state is entered by writing a keyword to the DORMANT register in whichever oscillator is active: ring
oscillator (Section 8.3) or crystal oscillator (Section 8.2). If both are active, the one providing the processor clock must
be stopped last because it will stop software from executing.
```
6.5.3.1. Waking from the DORMANT state

```
The system exits the DORMANT state on any of the following events:
```
- an alarm from the AON Timer which causes TIMER.ALARM to assert
- the assertion of an interrupt from GPIO Bank 0 to the^ DORMANT_WAKE^ interrupt destination
- the assertion of an interrupt from GPIO Bank 1 to the^ DORMANT_WAKE^ interrupt destination
When waking from the AON Timer you do not have to enable the IRQ output from POWMAN. It is sufficient for the timer
to fire, without being mapped to an interrupt output. Any AON Timer alarm comparison event which causes
TIMER.ALARM to assert causes the system to exit the DORMANT state. It is the actual alarm event which causes the
exit, not the TIMER.ALARM status; if you enter the DORMANT state with the TIMER.ALARM status set to 1 , but the timer
alarm comparison logic disabled by TIMER.ALARM_ENAB, you will not exit the DORMANT state.
The GPIO Bank registers have interrupt enable registers for interrupts targeting the DORMANT mode wake logic, such
as DORMANT_WAKE_INTE0. These are identical to the interrupt enable registers for interrupts targeting the processors,
such as PROC0_INTE0.
Waking from the DORMANT state restarts the oscillator which was disabled by entry to the DORMANT state. It does not
restart any other oscillators, or change any system-level clock configuration.

###### 6.5.4. Memory periphery power down

```
The main system memories (SRAM0 → SRAM9, mapped to bus addresses 0x20000000 to 0x20081fff), as well as the USB
DPRAM, can be partially powered down via the MEMPOWERDOWN register in the SYSCFG registers (see Section
12.15.2). This powers down the analogue circuitry used to access the SRAM storage array (the periphery of the SRAM)
but the storage array itself remains powered. Memories retain their current contents, but cannot be accessed. Static
power is reduced.
```
 CAUTION

```
Memories must not be accessed when powered down. Doing so can corrupt memory contents.
```
```
When powering a memory back up, a 20ns delay is required before accessing the memory again.
The XIP cache (see Section 4.4) can also be powered down, with CTRL.POWER_DOWN. The XIP hardware will not
generate cache accesses whilst the cache is powered down. Note that this is unlikely to produce a net power savings if
code continues to execute from XIP, due to the comparatively high voltages and switching capacitances of the external
QSPI bus.
```
###### 6.5.5. Full memory power down

```
RP2350 can completely power down its internal SRAM. Unlike the memory periphery power down described in Section
6.5.4, this completely disconnects the SRAM from the power supply, reducing static power to near zero.
Contents are lost when fully powering down memories. When you power memories up again following a power down,
```
6.5. Power reduction strategies 490

```
the contents is completely undefined.
There are three distinct SRAM power domains:
SRAM0
Contains main system SRAM for addresses 0x20000000 through 0x2003ffff (SRAM banks 0 through 3).
SRAM1
Contains main system SRAM for addresses 0x20040000 through 0x20081fff (SRAM banks 4 through 9).
```
```
XIP
Contains the XIP cache and the boot RAM.
```
```
The XIP power domain is always powered when the switched core domain is powered. The switched core domain is the
domain which includes all core logic, such as processors, bus fabric and peripherals. This means the memories in this
domain are always powered whenever software is running.
```
```
Besides powering memory down to save power, you can also leave memories powered up whilst powering down the
switched core domain. This retains program state in SRAM while eliminating static power dissipation in core logic.
```
```

```

###### 6.5.6. Programmer’s model

6.5.6.1. Sleep

```
The hello_sleep example (hello_sleep_aon.c in the pico-playground GitHub repository) demonstrates sleep mode. The
hello_sleep application (and underlying functions) takes the following steps:
```
1. Switches all clocks in the system to run from XOSC.
2. Configures an alarm in the AON Timer for 10 seconds in the future.
3. Sets the AON Timer clock as the only clock running in sleep mode using the SLEEP_ENx registers (see SLEEP_EN0).
4. Enables deep sleep in the processor.
5. Calls __wfi on processor, which will put the processor into deep sleep until woken by the AON Timer interrupt.
6. After 10 seconds, the AON Timer interrupt clears the alarm and then calls a user supplied callback function.
7. The callback function ends the example application.

 NOTE

```
To enter sleep mode, you must enable deep sleep on both proc0 and proc1, call __wfi, and ensure the DMA is
stopped.
```
```
hello_sleep makes use of functions in pico_sleep of the Pico Extras. In particular, sleep_goto_sleep_until puts the
processor to sleep until woken up by an AON Timer time assumed to be in the future.
```

178 }
```
6.5.6.2. DORMANT

```
The hello_dormant example, hello_dormant_gpio.c in the pico-playground GitHub repository, demonstrates the DORMANT
state. The example takes the following steps:
```
1. Switches all clocks in the system to run from XOSC.
2. Configures a GPIO interrupt for the dormant_wake hardware, which can wake both the ROSC and XOSC from dormant
    mode.
3. Puts the XOSC into dormant mode, which stops all processor execution (and all other clocked logic on the chip)
    immediately.
4. When GPIO 10 goes high, the XOSC restarts and program execution continues.
hello_dormant uses sleep_goto_dormant_until_pin under the hood:
