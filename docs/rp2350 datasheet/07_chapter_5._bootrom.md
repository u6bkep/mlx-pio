# Chapter 5. Bootrom

## Each RP2350 device contains 32 kB of mask ROM: a physically immutable memory resource described in Section 4.1.

## The RP2350 bootrom is the binary image etched into this ROM that contains the first instructions executed at reset.

## The bootrom concepts section (Section 5.1) covers the following topics, which are necessary background for

## understanding the bootrom features and their implementation:

## • Partition tables and their associated flash permissions

## • Bootable images, and the block loops that store their metadata

## • Versioning for images and partition tables, and A/B versions to support double-buffered upgrades

## • Hashing and signing to support secure boot with public key fingerprint in OTP (see also Section 10.1.1 in the

## security chapter)

## • Load maps for bootable images, and packaged binaries that the bootrom loads from flash into RAM according to

## the image’s load map

## • Anti-rollback protection to revoke older, compromised versions of software

## • Three forms of flash boot:

## ◦ Flash image boot, with a single binary image written directly into flash

## ◦ Flash partition boot, with the boot image selected from the partition table

## ◦ Partition-table-in-image boot, where the boot image is not contained in a partition table, but still embeds a

## partition table data structure to divide the flash address space

## • Boot slots for A/B versions of partition tables

## • Flash update boot, a special one-time boot mode that enables version downgrades following an image download

## • Try before you buy support for phased upgrades with image self-test

## • Address translation for flash images, which provides a consistent runtime address to images regardless of

## physical storage location

## • Automatic architecture switch when attempting to run a RISC-V binary on Arm, or vice versa

## • Targeting UF2 downloads to different flash partitions based on their permissions and the UF2 family ID

## Besides features mentioned as concepts above, the RP2350 bootrom implements:

## • The core 0 initial boot sequence (Section 5.2)

## • The core 1 low-power wait and launch protocol (Section 5.3)

## • Runtime APIs (Section 5.4) exported through the ROM symbol table, such as flash and OTP programming

## • A subset of runtime APIs available to Non-secure code, with permission for each API entry point individually

## configured by Secure code

## • A USB MSC class-compliant bootloader with UF2 support for downloading code/data to flash or RAM (Section 5.5),

## including support for versioning and A/B partitions

## • The USB PICOBOOT interface for advanced operations like OTP programming (Section 5.6) and to support^ picotool

## or other host side tools

## • Support for white-labelling all USB exposed information/identifiers (Section 5.7)

## • A UART bootloader providing a minimal shell to load an SRAM binary from a host microcontroller (Section 5.8)

## You should read the bootrom concepts section before diving into the features in the list above. RP2350 adds a

## considerable amount of new functionality compared to the RP2040 bootrom. If you are in a terrible hurry, Section 5.9.

## covers the absolute minimum requirements for a binary to be bootable on RP2350 when secure boot is not enabled.

## 5.1. Bootrom concepts

Bold type in the following sections introduces a concept. This chapter frequently refers back to these concepts.

#### 5.1.1. Secure and Non-secure

```
This datasheet uses the (capitalised) terms Secure and Non-secure to refer to the Arm execution states of the same
name, defined in the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual. The uncapitalised term "secure" has no special meaning.
In some contexts, Secure can also refer to a RISC-V core, usually one running at the Machine privilege level. For
example, the low-level flash APIs are exported to Arm Secure code and RISC-V code only, so Secure serves as a
shorthand for this type of API.
A secured RP2350 is a device where secure boot is enabled (Section 5.10.1). This is not the same as the Secure state,
since the device may run a mixture of Secure and Non-secure code after completing the secure boot process.
```
#### 5.1.2. Partition tables

```
A partition table divides flash into a maximum of 16 distinct regions, known as partitions. Each partition defines
attributes such as flash permissions for a contiguous range of flash addresses. The PARTITION_TABLE data structure
describes a partition table, and is an example of a block. Use of partition tables is strictly optional.
Dividing flash into multiple partitions enables you to:
```
- Store more than one executable image on the device. For example:

### ◦ For A/B boot versions (Section 5.1.7)

### ◦ For different architectures (Arm/RISC-V) or Secure/Non-secure

### ◦ For use with a custom bootloader

- Provision space for data. For example:

### ◦ Embedded file systems

### ◦ Shared Wi-Fi firmware

### ◦ Application resources

- Provide different security attributes for different regions of flash (Section 5.1.3)
- Target UF2 downloads to different partitions based on family ID (Section 5.1.18), including custom-defined UF
    families specific to your platform
For more information about PARTITION_TABLE discovery during flash boot, see Section 5.1.5.2.
Partition tables can be versioned to support A/B upgrades. They can also be hashed and signed for security and
integrity purposes. We recommend hashing partition tables to ensure that they haven’t been corrupted. This is
especially important when using boot slots to update your partition table, since a corrupted partition table with a higher
version could be chosen over a non-corrupted partition table with a lower version.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 354

##### 5.1.2.1. Partition attributes

Each partition specifies partition attributes for the flash addresses it encompasses, including:

- Start/end offsets within the logical 32 MB address space of the two flash windows; these offsets are specified in
    multiples of a flash sector (4 kB)

### ◦ Bootable partitions must reside wholly in the first 16 MB flash window, due to limitations of the address

translation hardware

- Access permissions for the partition: read/write for each of Secure (S), Non-secure (NS) and bootloader (BL) access
- Information on which UF2 family IDs may be dropped into the partition via the UF2 bootloader
- An optional 64-bit identifier
- An optional name (a string for human-readable identification)
- Whether to ignore the partition during Arm or RISC-V boot
- Information to group partitions together (see Section 5.1.7 and Section 5.1.18)
Section 5.9.4 documents the full list of partition attributes, along with the PARTITION_TABLE binary format.
If there is no partition table, the entirety of flash is considered a single region, with no restricted permissions. Without a
partition table, there is no support for custom UF2 family IDs, therefore you must use one of the standard IDs specified
in Table 455.

#### 5.1.3. Flash permissions

```
One of the roles of the partition tables introduced in Section 5.1.2 is to define flash permissions, or simply permissions.
The partition table stores one set of permission flags for each partition: all bytes covered by a single partition have the
same permissions. The partition table separately defines permissions for unpartitioned space: flash addresses which
do not match any of partitions defined in the partition table.
Separate read/write permissions are specified for each of Secure (S), Non-secure (NS) and bootloader (BL) access.
Bootloader permissions control where UF2s can be written to, and what can be accessed via picotool when the device is
in BOOTSEL mode.
Because flash permissions may be changed dynamically at runtime, part of the partition table is resident in RAM at
runtime. You can modify this table to add permissions for other areas of flash at runtime, without changing the partition
table stored in flash itself. There is no bootrom API for this, however the in-memory partition table format is
documented, and a pointer is available in the ROM table. The SDK provides APIs to wrap this functionality.
```
#### 5.1.4. Image definitions

An image is a contiguous data blob which may contain code, or data, or a mixture. An image definition is a block of
metadata embedded near the start of an image. The metadata stored in the image definition allows the bootrom to
recognise valid executable and non-executable images. The IMAGE_DEF data structure represents the image definition in a
binary format, and is an example of a block.
For executable images, the IMAGE_DEF could be considered similar to an ELF header, as it can include image attributes
such as architecture/chip, entry-point, load addresses, etc.
All IMAGE_DEFs can contain version information and be hashed or signed. Whilst the bootrom only directly boots
executable images, it does provide facilities for selecting a valid (possibly signed) data image from one or more
partitions on behalf of a user application.
The presence of a valid IMAGE_DEF allows the bootrom to discern a valid application in flash from random data. As a
result, you must include a valid IMAGE_DEF in any executable binary that you intend to boot.
For more information about how the bootrom discovers IMAGE_DEFs, see the section on block loops.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 355

```
For details about the IMAGE_DEF format itself, see Section 5.9.3.
For a description of the minimum requirements for a bootable image, see Section 5.9.5.
```
#### 5.1.5. Blocks and block loops

##### 5.1.5.1. Blocks

```
IMAGE_DEFs and PARTITION_TABLEs are both examples of blocks. A block is a recognisable, self-checking data structure
containing one or more distinct data items. The type of the first item in a block defines the type of that entire block.
Blocks are backwards and forwards compatible; item types will not be changed in the future in ways that could cause
existing code to misinterpret data. Consumers of blocks (including the bootrom) must skip items within the block
whose types are currently listed as reserved; encountering reserved item types must not cause a block to fail validation.
To be considered valid, a block must have the following properties:
```
- it must begin with the 4 byte magic header,^ PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_START^ (0xffffded3)
- the end of each (variably-sized) item must also be the start of another valid item
- the last item must have type^ PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_2BS_LAST^ and specify the correct full length of the block
- it must end with the 4 byte magic footer,^ PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_END^ (0xab123579)
The magic header and footer values are chosen to be unlikely to appear in executable Arm and RISC-V code. For more
information about the block format, see Section 5.9.1.
Given a region of memory or flash (such as a partition), blocks are found by searching the first 4 kB of that given region
(for flash boot) or the entire region (for RAM/OTP image boots) for a valid block which is part of a valid block loop.
Currently IMAGE_DEFs and PARTITION_TABLEs are the only types of block used by the RP2350 bootrom, but the block format
reserves encoding space for future expansion.

##### 5.1.5.2. Block loops

```
A block loop is a cyclic linked list of blocks (a linked loop). Each block has a relative pointer to the next block, and the
last block must link to the first. A single block can form a block loop by linking back to itself with a relative pointer of 0.
The first block in a loop must have the lowest address of all blocks in the loop.
The purpose of a block loop is threefold:
```
- to discover which blocks belong to the same image without a brute-force search
- to allow metadata to be appended in post-link processing steps
- to detect parts of the binary being overwritten in a way that breaks the loop
For flash image boot the bootrom searches the first 4 kB of flash; the 4 kB size is a compromise between allowing
flexibility for different languages' memory layouts, while avoiding scanning too much flash when trying different flash
access modes and QSPI clock frequencies. flash partition boot also limits its search to the first 4 kB of the partition.
The search window may be larger, such as a RAM image boot following a UF2 SRAM download, where the search
window is all of SRAM. For the fastest boot time, locate the first block as close to the beginning of the binary as
possible.
Block loops support multiple blocks because:
- Signing an image duplicates the existing^ IMAGE_DEF^ and adds another (bigger)^ IMAGE_DEF^ with additional signature
information.
- An image may contain multiple^ IMAGE_DEFs, for example, with different signing keys.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 356

- Placing a block at both the beginning and end of an image can detect some partial overwrites of the image (for
    example, due to an overly enthusiastic absolute-addressed UF2 download). The SDK does this by default. Hashing
    or signing the entire image is more robust, since it detects corruption in the middle of the image.
- A universal binary image might contain code for both Arm and RISC-V, including^ IMAGE_DEFs for both.
- PARTITION_TABLEs and^ IMAGE_DEFs are both present in the same block loop in the case of an embedded partition table.
If a block loop contains multiple IMAGE_DEFs or multiple PARTITION_TABLEs, the winner is generally the last one seen in
linked-list order. The exception is the case of two IMAGE_DEFs for different architectures (Arm and RISC-V); an IMAGE_DEF
for the architecture currently executing the bootrom is always preferred over one for a different architecture.

#### 5.1.6. Block versioning

```
Any block may contain a version. Version information consists of a tuple of either two or three 16-bit values:
(rollback).major.minor, where the rollback part is optional. An item of type VERSION contains the binary data structure
which defines the version of a block.
The rollback version may only be specified for IMAGE_DEFs and defaults to zero if not present. You cannot specify this
version for partition tables. The rollback version can be used on a secured RP2350, where it, along with a current
rollback verson number stored in OTP, can prevent installation of older, vulnerable code once a newer version is
installed (Section 5.1.11).
The full version number can be used to pick the latest version between two IMAGE_DEFs or two PARTITION_TABLEs (see
Section 5.1.7). Versions compare in lexicographic order:
```
1. If version x has a different rollback version than version y, then the greater rollback version determines which
    version is greater overall
2. Else if version x has a different major version than version y, then the greater major version determines which
    version is greater overall
3. Else the minor version determines which of x and y is greater
See Section 5.9.2.1 for full details on the VERSION item in a block.

#### 5.1.7. A/B versions

```
A pair of partitions may be grouped into an A/B pair. By logically grouping A and B partitions, you can keep the current
executable image (or data) in one partition, and write a newer version into the other partition. When you finish writing a
new version, you can safely switch to it, reverting to the older version if problems arise. This avoids partially written
states that could render RP2350 un-bootable.
```
- When booting an A/B partition pair, the bootrom typically uses the partition with the higher version. For scenarios
    where this is not the case, see Section 5.1.16.
- When dragging a UF2 onto the BOOTSEL USB drive, the UF2 targets the^ opposite^ A/B partition to the one preferred
    at boot. See Section 5.1.18 for more details.

 (^) NOTE
It is also possible to have A/B versions of the partition table. For more information about this advanced topic, see
Section 5.1.15.

#### 5.1.8. Hashing and signing

Any block may be hashed or signed. A hashed block stores the image hash value (see Section 5.9.2.3). At runtime, the
bootrom calculates a hash and compares it to the stored hash to determine if the block is valid. Hashes guard against
5.1. Bootrom concepts 357

```
corruption of an image, but do not provide any security guarantees.
On a secured RP2350, a hash is not sufficient for an image to be considered valid. All images must have a signature: a
hash encrypted by a private key, plus metadata (also covered by the hash) describing how the hash was generated. This
signature is stored as part of an IMAGE_DEF block. An image with a signature in its IMAGE_DEF block is called a signed
image.
```
#####  NOTE

```
For background on signatures and boot keys, see the introduction to secure boot in the security chapter (Section
10.1.1).
To verify a signed image, the bootrom decrypts the hash stored in the signature using a secp256k1 public key. The
bootrom also computes its own hash of the image and compares its measured hash value with the one in the signature.
The public key is also stored in the block via a SIGNATURE item (see Section 5.9.2.4): this key’s (SHA-256) hash must
match one of the boot key hashes stored in OTP locations BOOTKEY0_0 onwards. Up to four public keys can be
registered in OTP, with the count defined by BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_VALID and BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_INVALID. A hash of a
key is also referred to as a key fingerprint.
The data to be hashed is defined by a HASH_DEF item (see Section 5.9.2.2), which indicates the type of hash. It also
indicates how much of the block itself is to be hashed. For a signed block, the hash must contain all contents of the
block up to the final SIGNATURE item.
To be useful your hash or signature must cover actual image data in addition to the metadata stored in the block. The
block’s load map item specifies which data the bootrom hashes during hash or signature verification.
The above discussion mostly applies to IMAGE_DEFs. On a secured RP2350 with the
BOOT_FLAGS0.SECURE_PARTITION_TABLE flag set, the bootrom also enforces signatures on PARTITION_TABLEs.
```
#### 5.1.9. Load maps

```
A load map describes regions of the binary and what to do with them before the bootrom runs the binary.
The load map supports:
```
- Copying portions of the binary from flash to RAM (or to the XIP cache)
- Clearing parts of RAM (either^ .bss^ clear, or erasing uninitialised memory during secure boot)
- Defining what parts of the binary are included in a hash or signature
- Preventing the flushing of the XIP cache when to keep loaded lines pinned up to the point the binary starts
For full details on the LOAD_MAP item type of IMAGE_DEF blocks, see Section 5.9.3.2.
When booting a signed binary from flash, it is desirable to load the signed data and code into RAM before checking the
signature and subsequently executing it. Otherwise, an adversary could replace the flash device in between the
signature check and execution, subverting the check. For this reason, the load map also serves as a convenient
description of what to include in a hash or signature. The load map itself is covered by the hash or signature, and the
entire metadata block is loaded into RAM before processing, so it is not itself subject to this time-of-check versus time-
of-use concern.

#### 5.1.10. Packaged binaries

As described in Section 5.1.9, signed binaries in flash on a secured RP2350 are commonly loaded from flash into RAM,
go through signature verification in RAM, and then execute from the verified version in RAM.
A packaged binary is a binary stored in flash that runs entirely from RAM. The binary is likely compiled to run from RAM
as a RAM-only binary (unfortunately named no_flash in SDK parlance), but subsequently post-processed for flash
5.1. Bootrom concepts 358

```
residence. The bootrom unpackages the binary into RAM before execution.
As part of the packaging process, tooling like picotool adds a LOAD_MAP that tells the bootrom which parts of the flash-
resident image it must load into RAM, and where to put them. This tooling may also hash or sign the binary in the same
step. In this case, the bootrom hashes the data it loads as it unpackages the binary, as well as relevant metadata such
as the LOAD_MAP itself. The bootrom compares the resulting hash to the precomputed hash or signature in the IMAGE_DEF to
verify the unpackaged contents in RAM before running those contents.
Compare this with RP2040, where a flash-resident binary which executes from RAM (a copy_to_ram binary in SDK
parlance) must begin by executing from flash, then copy itself to RAM before continuing from there. In the RP2040 case,
the loader itself (or rather the SDK crt0) executes in-place in flash to perform the copy. This makes it impossible to
perform any trustworthy level of verification, because the loader itself executes in untrusted memory.
```
#### 5.1.11. Anti-rollback protection

```
Anti-rollback on a secured RP2350 prevents booting an older binary which may have known vulnerabilities. It prevents
this even if the binary is correctly signed and meets all other requirements for bootability.
Full IMAGE_DEF version information is of the form (rollback).major.minor, where the rollback part is optional. If a rollback
version is present, it is accompanied by a list of OTP rows whose ordered values are used to form a thermometer of
bits indicating the minimum rollback version that may run on the device.
A thermometer code is a base-1 (unary) number where the integer value is one plus the index of the most-significant set
bit. For example, the bit strings 00001111 , 00001001 , and 00001000 all encode a value of four, and the all-zeroes bit pattern
encodes a value of zero. The bootrom uses this encoding because:
```
- it allows OTP rows containing counters to be incremented, and
- it does not allow them to be decremented
On a secured RP2350, the bootrom compares the rollback version of the IMAGE_DEF against the thermometer-coded
minimum rollback version stored in OTP. If the IMAGE_DEF value is lower, the bootrom refuses to boot the image.
The IMAGE_DEF rollback version is covered by the image’s signature, thus cannot be modified by an adversary who does
not know the signing key. The list of OTP rows which define the chip’s minimum rollback version is also stored in the
program image, and also covered by the image signature.
The list of OTP rows in the IMAGE_DEF must always have at least one bit spare beyond the IMAGE_DEF's rollback version
(enforced by picotool). As a result, older binaries always contain enough information for the bootrom to detect that the
chip’s minimum rollback version has been incremented past the rollback version in the IMAGE_DEF. You can append more
rows to the list on newer binaries to accommodate higher rollback versions without ambiguity.
When an executable image with a non-zero rollback version is successfully booted, its rollback version is written to the
OTP thermometer. The BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED flag may be used to require an IMAGE_DEF have a rollback
version on a secured RP2350. This flag is set automatically when updating the rollback version in OTP.

#####  NOTE

```
An IMAGE_DEF with a rollback version of 0 will not automatically set the BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED flag, so
it is recommended that the minimum rollback version used is 1, unless the BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED
flag is manually set during provisioning.
```
#### 5.1.12. Flash image boot

RP2350 is designed primarily to run code from a QSPI flash device, either in-package or soldered separately to the
circuit board. Code runs either in-place in flash, or in SRAM after being loaded from flash. Flash boot is the process of
discovering that code and preparing to run it. Flash image boot uses a program binary stored directly in flash rather
than in a flash partition. Flash image boot requires the bootrom to discover a block loop starting within the first 4 kB of
flash which contains a valid IMAGE_DEF (and no PARTITION_TABLE).
5.1. Bootrom concepts 359

```
Flash image boot has no partition table, so it cannot be used with A/B version checking, which requires separate A/B
partitions. The IMAGE_DEF will boot if it is valid (which includes requiring a signature on a secured RP2350).
For the non-signed case, the IMAGE_DEF can be as small as a 20-bytes; see Section 5.9.5.
```
#####  TIP

```
A more complicated version of this scenario stores multiple IMAGE_DEFs in the block loop. In this case, the last
IMAGE_DEF for the current architecture is booted, if valid. You can use this to implement universal binaries for various
supported architectures, or to include multiple signatures for targeting devices with different keys.
```
#### 5.1.13. Flash partition boot

```
If a PARTITION_TABLE, but no IMAGE_DEF, is found in the valid block loop that starts within the first 4 kB of flash, and it is valid
(including signature if necessary on a secured RP2350), the bootrom searches that partition table’s partitions for an
executable image to boot. This process, when successful, is referred to as flash partition boot.
The partitions are searched in order, skipping those marked as ignored for the current architecture. The bootrom
ignores partitions as an optimisation, or to prevent automatic architecture switching.
If the partition is not part of an A/B pair, the first 4 kB is searched for the start of a valid block loop. If a valid block loop
is found, and it contains an executable image with a valid (including signature on a secured RP2350) IMAGE_DEF, then that
executable image is chosen for boot.
If the partition is the A partition of an A/B pair, the bootrom searches both partitions as described above. If both
partitions result in a bootable IMAGE_DEF, the IMAGE_DEF with the higher version number is chosen. Otherwise, the valid
IMAGE_DEF is chosen. There are some exceptions to this rule in advanced scenarios; see Section 5.1.16 and Section
5.1.17 for details.
```
#### 5.1.14. Partition-Table-in-Image boot

```
If both a PARTITION_TABLE and an IMAGE_DEF block are found in the valid block loop that starts within the first 4 kB of flash, a
third type of flash boot takes place. The IMAGE_DEF and PARTITION_TABLE must only be recognised, not necessarily valid or
correctly signed. This stipulation prevents a causality loop.
This is known as partition-table-in-image boot, since the application contains the partition table (instead of vice versa).
This partition table is referred to as an embedded partition table.
The PARTITION_TABLE is loaded as the current partition table, and the IMAGE_DEF is launched directly. The table defined by
the PARTITION_TABLE is not searched for IMAGE_DEFs to boot.
The following common cases might use this scenario:
```
- You are only using the^ PARTITION_TABLE^ for flash permissions. You want to load that partition table, then boot as
    normal.
- The^ IMAGE_DEF^ contains a small bootloader stored alongside the partition table. In this case, the partition table will
    once again be loaded, and the associated image entered. The entered image will then likely pick a partition from
    the partition table, and launch an image from there itself.

#### 5.1.15. Flash boot slots

The previous sections within this chapter discuss block loops starting within the first 4 kB of flash. Such a block loop
contained either an IMAGE_DEF, a partition table (searched for IMAGE_DEFs), or an IMAGE_DEF and a PARTITION_TABLE (not
searched).
All the previously mentioned cases discovered their block loop in slot 0. Under certain circumstances, the neighbouring
slot 1 is also searched.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 360

```
Slot 0 starts at the beginning of flash, and has a size of n × 4 kB sectors. Slot 1 has the same size and follows
immediately after slot 0. The value of n defaults to 1. Both slots are 4 kB in size, but you can override this value by
specifying a value in FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE and then setting
BOOT_FLAGS0.OVERRIDE_FLASH_PARTITION_SLOT_SIZE.
Similarly to how a choice can be made between IMAGE_DEFs in A/B partitions, a choice can be made between A/B
PARTITION_TABLEs via the two boot slots. This allows for versioning partition tables, targeted drag and drop of UF2s
(Section 5.1.18) containing partition tables, etc. similar to the process used for images.
Slot 1 is only of use when potentially using partition tables. In the simple case of an IMAGE_DEF and no PARTITION_TABLE
found in a block loop starting in slot 0, that image likely actually overlays the space where slot 1 would be, but in any
case, slot 1 is ignored since there is no PARTITION_TABLE.
If slot 0 contains a PARTITION_TABLE or does not contain an IMAGE_DEF (including nothing/garbage in slot 0), slot 1 can be
considered. As an optimisation, in the former case, the scanning of slot 1 can be prevented by setting the singleton flag
in the PARTITION_TABLE.
```
#####  NOTE

```
When IMAGE_DEFs are also present in the slots, the PARTITION_TABLE's VERSION item determines which of slot 0 and slot 1
to use. The IMAGE_DEF metadata is ignored for the purpose of version comparison.
```
#### 5.1.16. Flash update boot and version downgrade

```
Normally the choice of slot 0 versus slot 1, and partition A versus partition B, is made based on the version of the valid
PARTITION_TABLE or IMAGE_DEF in those slots or partitions respectively. The greater of the two versions wins.
It is however perfectly valid to downgrade to a lower-versioned IMAGE_DEF when using A/B partitions, provided this does
not violate anti-rollback rules on a secured RP2350.
Downloading the new image (and its IMAGE_DEF) into the non-currently-booting partition and doing a normal reboot will
not work in this case, as the newly downloaded image has a lower version.
For this purpose, you can enable a flash update boot boot by passing the FLASH_UPDATE boot type constant flag through
the watchdog scratch registers and a pointer to the start of the region of flash that has just been updated.
The bootrom automatically performs a flash update boot after programming a flash UF2 written to the USB Mass
Storage drive. You can also invoke a flash update boot programmatically via the reboot() API (see Section 5.4.8.24).
The flash address range passed through the reboot parameters is treated specially during a flash update boot. A
PARTITION_TABLE in a slot, or IMAGE_DEF in a partition, will be chosen for boot irrespective of version, if the start of the region
is the start of the respective slot or partition.
In order for the downgrade to persist, the first sector of the previously booting slot or partition must be erased so that
the newly installed PARTITION_TABLE or IMAGE_DEF will continue to be chosen on subsequent boots. This erase is performed
as follows during a FLASH_UPDATE boot.
```
1. When a PARTITION_TABLE is valid (and correctly signed if necessary) and its slot is chosen for boot, the first sector of
    the other slot is erased.
2. When a valid (and correctly signed if necessary) IMAGE_DEF is launched, the first sector of the other image is erased.
3. On explicit request by the image, after it is launched, the first sector of the other image is erased. This is an
    alternative to the standard behaviour in the previous bullet, and is selected by a special "Try Before You Buy" flag in
    the IMAGE_DEF. For more information about this feature, see Section 5.1.17.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 361

#####  NOTE

Flash update and version downgrade have no effect when using a single slot, or standalone (non A/B) partitions.

#### 5.1.17. Try before you buy

```
Try before you buy (abbreviated TBYB) is an IMAGE_DEF-only feature that allows for a completely safe cycle of version
upgrade:
```
1. An executable image is running from say partition B.
2. A new image is downloaded into partition A.
3. On download completion, a FLASH_UPDATE reboot is performed for the newly updated partition A.
4. The bootrom will preferentially try to boot partition A (due to the flash update). Note that a non TBYB image will
    always be chosen over a TBYB image in A/B partitions during a normal non-FLASH_UPDATE boot.

### ◦ If the new image fails validation/signature then the old image in partition B will be used on subsequent (non-

FLASH_UPDATE) boots, recovering from the failed upgrade.

5. If the new image is valid (and correctly signed if necessary), it is entered under a watchdog timer, and has 16.
    seconds to mark itself OK via the explicit_buy() function.

### ◦ If the image calls back, the first 4 kB sector of the other partition (containing image B) is erased, and the

TBYB flag of the current image is cleared, so that A becomes the preferred partition for subsequent boots.

### ◦ If the image does not call back within the allotted time, then the system reboots, and will continue to boot

```
partition B (containing the original image) as partition A is still marked as TBYB image.
The erase of the first sector of the opposite partition in the A/B pair severs its image’s block loop, rendering it
unbootable. This ensures the tentative image booted under TBYB becomes the preferred boot image going forward,
even if the opposite image had a higher version.
The watchdog timeout is fixed at 16.7 seconds (24-bit count on a 1-microsecond timebase). This can be shortened after
entering the target image, for example if it only needs a few hundred milliseconds for its self-test routine. It can also be
extended by reloading the watchdog counter, at the risk of getting stuck in the tentative image if it fails in a way that
repeatedly reloads the watchdog.
```
#### 5.1.18. UF2 targeting

```
Section 5.5 describes the USB Mass Storage drive, and the ability to download UF2 files to that drive to store and/or
execute code/data on the RP2350.
Since RP2350 supports multiple processor architectures, and partition tables with multiple partitions, some information
on the device must be used to determine what to do with a flash-addressed UF2. Depending on the context, the flash
addresses in the UF2 may be absolute flash storage addresses (as was always the case on RP2040), or runtime
addresses of code and data within a flash partition. UF2 targeting refers to the rules the bootrom applies to interpret
flash addresses in a UF2 file.
UF2 supports a 32-bit family ID embedded in the file. This enables the device to recognise firmware that targets it
specifically, as opposed to firmware intended for some other device. The RP2350 bootrom recognises some standard
UF2 family IDs (rp2040, rp2350-arm-s, rp2350-arm-ns, rp2350-riscv, data and absolute) defined in Table 455. You may define
your own family IDs in the partition table for more refined targeting.
The UF2 family ID is used as follows:
```
1. A UF2 with the absolute family ID is downloaded without regard to partition boundaries. A partition table (if present)
    or OTP configuration define whether absolute family ID downloads are allowed. The default factory settings do
    allow for absolute family ID downloads.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 362

2. If there is no partition table, then the data, rp2350-arm-s (if Arm is enabled) and rp2350-riscv (if RISC-V is enabled)
    family IDs are allowed by default. The UF2 is always downloaded to the start of flash.
3. If there is a partition table, then non-absolute family IDs target a single partition under the control of the partition
    table:
       a. A UF2 will not be downloaded to a partition that doesn’t have BL-write flash permissions
b. Each partition lists which family IDs it accepts (both RP2350 standard and user defined)
c. With A/B partitions; the A partition indicates the family IDs supported, and the UF2 goes to the partition that
isn’t the currently booting one (strictly the one that won’t be the one chosen if the device were rebooted now).
d. Further refinement with A/B is allowed to support secondary A/B partitions containing data/executables used
(owned) by the main partitions; see Section 5.1.18.1 for detailed information.
For details of the exact rules used when picking a UF2 target partition, see Section 5.5.3.

 (^) NOTE
UF2 family ids are used for partition targeting when copying UF2s to the USB drive, or when using picotool load -p.
When using picotool load without the -p flag images can be written anywhere in flash that has BL-write permissions.

##### 5.1.18.1. Owned partitions

```
An executable might require data from another partition (such as Wi-Fi firmware). When the main executable is stored in
A/B partitions, for safe upgrades, it may be desirable to associate two other partitions C and D with the primary A and B
partitions, such that:
```
- the data in partition C is used for executable in partition A, and
- the data in partition D is used for the executable in partition B.
In this scenario A is marked as the owner of C in the partition table, and C is A’s owned partition. This affects UF
image downloads which (due to their UF2 family ID) target partitions C and D.
When a UF2 download targets the C/D partition pair, the bootrom checks the state of the A and B owning partitions to
determine which of the owned partitions (C and D) receives the download. By default:
- If B would be the target partition for a UF2 with an A/B-compatible family ID, then D is the target for a UF2 with the
C/D compatible family ID.
- Conversely, when A is the target partition for A/B downloads, C is the target partition for C/D downloads.
The FLAGS_UF2_DOWNLOAD_AB_NON_BOOTABLE_OWNER_AFFINITY flag in the partition table reverses this mapping.

#### 5.1.19. Address translation

RP2040 required images to be stored at the beginning of flash (0x10000000). RP2350 supports storing executable images
in a partitions at arbitrary locations, to support more robust upgrade cycles via A/B versions, among other uses. This
presents the issue that the address an executable is linked at, and therefore the binary contents of the image, would
have to depend on the address it is stored at. This can be worked around to an extent with position-independent code,
at cost to code size and performance.
RP2350 avoids this pitfall with hardware and bootrom support for address translation. An image stored at any 4 kB-
aligned location in flash can appear at flash address 0x10000000 at runtime. The SDK continues to assume an image base
of 0x10000000 by default.
When launching an image from a partition, the bootrom initialises QMI registers ATRANS0 through ATRANS3 to map a
flash runtime address of 0x10000000 (by default) to the flash storage address of the start of the partition. It sets the total
size of the mapped region to the size of the partition, with a maximum size of 16 MB. Accessing flash addresses
beyond the size of the booted partition (but below the 0x11000000 chip select watermark) returns a bus fault.
5.1. Bootrom concepts 363

```
As an example, if the booted partition was 6 MB big, starting 1 MB into flash, the registers would be set up as follows:
Name / Memory Start Flash Start Size
ATRANS0 / 0x10000000 0x10100000 4 MB
ATRANS1 / 0x10400000 0x10500000 2 MB
ATRANS2 / 0x10800000 - 0
ATRANS3 / 0x10c00000 - 0
This maps the physical flash range from 0x10100000-0x10700000 to flash addresses 0x10000000-0x10600000, ensuring the
partition appears at the start of flash at runtime.
In this case, since ATRANS2 and ATRANS3 aren’t needed to map the partition, they could be used by the application to
map another part of flash.
Mapping the start of the partition to a runtime address of 0x10000000 is the default behaviour, but you may choose a
different address, with some restrictions. The bootrom allows for runtime address values of 0x10000000, 0x10400000,
0x10800000, and 0x10c00000 for the beginning of the mapped regions, with the choice specified in the IMAGE_DEF. You must
link your binary to run at the correct, higher base address. This is useful, for example, when an application runs from a
high flash address and remains mapped there while launching a second application at address 0x10000000. You might
use this setup when a Secure image provides services to a Non-secure client image.
This custom address translation is enabled by a negative ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA value (see Section 5.9.3.5). The above
four runtime addresses translate to a ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA of 0 , -0x400000, -0x800000, or -0xc00000, which are the only
supported non-positive values. The delta indicates how many bytes into the partition the runtime address 0x
appears. A negative delta value indicates that address 0x10000000 appears before the start of the partition; the partition
starts that many bytes higher than 0x10000000.
Positive values are also useful, for example, when prepending data to an already linked image as a post-processing
step. Positive deltas must be multiples of 4 kB. For example, a ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA of 0x1000 will set up address
translation so that the image data starting at offset 0x1000 within the partition is mapped to 0x10000000 at runtime,
omitting the first 4 kB of the image from the mapped region. The first 4 kB is inaccessible except through the
untranslated XIP window, which defaults to Secure access only.
```
#####  NOTE

```
Because address translation within the 0x100000000 → 0x11000000 and 0x11000000 → 0x12000000 windows is independent,
it is only possible to boot from partitions which are entirely contained within the first 16 MB of flash.
This address translation is performed by hardware in the QMI. For more information, see Section 12.14.4.
```
#### 5.1.20. Automatic architecture switching

```
If the bootrom encounters a valid and correctly signed IMAGE_DEF for the non-current architecture (RISC-V when booted in
Arm mode, or Arm when booted in RISC-V), it performs an automatic architecture switch. The bootrom initiates a reboot
into the correct architecture for the binary it discovered, which then boots successfully on the second attempt.
Information passed in watchdog scratch registers (such as a RAM image boot type) is retained, so that the second boot
makes the same decisions as the first, and arrives at the same preferred image to boot.
This happens only when:
```
- The architecture to be switched to is available according to OTP critical flags
- The architecture switch feature is not disabled by the BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_AUTO_SWITCH_ARCH flag
- The bootrom found no valid binary for the^ current^ architecture before finding one for the^ other^ architecture
5.1. Bootrom concepts 364

#####  TIP

```
When storing executable images for both architectures in flash, it’s usually preferable to boot an image for the
current architecture. To do this, keep the images in different partitions, marking the partition for Arm as ignored
during boot under RISC-V and vice versa. This avoids always picking the image in the first partition and auto-
switching to run it under the other architecture.
For hardware support details for architecture switching, see Section 3.9.
```
## 5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence

```
The bootrom contains the first instructions the processors execute following a reset. Both processors enter the
bootrom at the same time, and in the same location, but the boot sequence runs mostly on core 0.
Core 1 redirects very early in the boot sequence to a low-power state where it waits to be launched, after boot, by user
software on core 0. If core 1 is unused, it remains in this low-power state.
Source Code Reference
The sequence described in this section is implemented on Arm by the source files arm8_bootrom_rt0.S
and varm_boot_path.c in the bootrom source code repository. RISC-V cores instead begin from
riscv_bootrom_rt0.S, but share the boot path implementation with Arm.
```
#### 5.2.1. Boot outcomes

The bootrom decides the boot outcome based on the following system state:

- The contents of the attached QSPI memory device on chip select 0, if any
- The contents of POWMAN registers BOOT0 through BOOT
- The contents of watchdog registers SCRATCH4 through SCRATCH
- The contents of OTP, particularly CRIT1, BOOT_FLAGS0 and BOOT_FLAGS
- The QSPI^ CSn^ pin being driven low externally (to select BOOTSEL)
- The QSPI^ SD1^ pin being driven high externally (to select UART boot in BOOTSEL mode)
Based on these, the outcome of the boot sequence may be to:
- Call code through a^ vector^ specified in^ SCRATCH^ or^ BOOT^ registers prior to the most recent reboot, for example, into
code retained in RAM following a power-up from a low-power state.
- Run an image from external flash.

### ◦ This can happen in one of two ways: either the image runs in-place directly from external flash, or the image is

loaded into RAM during the boot sequence.

### ◦ In-package flash on RP2354 is external for boot purposes. It’s a separate silicon die, and the RP2350 die

doesn’t implicitly trust it.

- Run an image preloaded into SRAM (distinct from the vector case).
- Load and run an image from OTP into SRAM.
- Enter the USB bootloader.
- Enter the UART bootloader.
- Perform a one-shot operation requested via the reboot() API, such as a flash update boot. This may be requested
5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 365

by the user, or by the UART or UF2 bootloaders.

- Refuse to boot, due to lack of suitable images and the UART and USB bootloaders being disabled via OTP.
This section makes no distinction between the different types of flash boot (flash image boot, flash partition boot and
flash partition-table-in-image boot). Likewise, it does not distinguish these types from packaged binaries, which are
loaded into RAM at boot time, because these are just flash binaries with a special load map. This section just describes
the sequence of decisions the bootrom makes to decide which medium to boot from.

#### 5.2.2. Sequence

```
This section enumerates the steps of the processor-controlled boot sequence for Arm processors. There are some
minor differences on Arm versus RISC-V, which are discussed in Section 5.2.2.2.
A valid image in Table 451 refers to one that contains a valid block loop, with one of those blocks being a valid image
definition. On a secured RP2350 this image must be (correctly) signed, and must meet all other security requirements
such as minimum rollback version.
Shaded cells in the Action column of Table 451 indicate a boot outcome as described in Section 5.2.1. Other cells are
transitory states which continue through the sequence. Both cores start the sequence at Entry.
The main sequential steps in Table 451 are:
```
- Entry
- Core 1 Wait
- Boot Path Start
- Await Rescue
- Generate Boot Random
- Check POWMAN Vector
- Check Watchdog Vector
- Prepare for Image Boot
- Try RAM Image Boot
- Check BOOTSEL
- Try OTP Boot
- Try Flash Boot
- Prepare for BOOTSEL
- Enter USB Boot
- Enter UART Boot
- Boot Failure

BOOTDIS.NOW or POWMAN BOOTDIS.NOW flag is set).
Boot type is VECTOR Outcome: Set Secure main sp, then call into the entry point provided.
(Return from VECTOR) Go to Prepare for Image Boot.
Boot type is RAM_IMAGE Make note for later: this requests a scan of a RAM region for a preloaded image.

Condition (If...) Action (Then...)
Valid image found Outcome: Enter flash image in the manner specified by its image definition. This may
including loading some flash contents into RAM.

Step: Prepare for BOOTSEL
Always Erase SRAM0 through SRAM9, XIP cache and USB RAM to all-zeroes before
relinquishing memory and peripherals to Non-secure.

Check QSPI SD1 pin (with default pull-down resistor) for UART/USB boot select.
Scan flash for a partition table (always using an 03h serial read command with an SCK

permitted.
Both USB interfaces
disabled
Go to Boot Failure.
Otherwise Outcome: Enter USB bootloader. The bootloader reboots if a UF2 image is downloaded,
marking a FLASH_UPDATE in the watchdog scratch registers if applicable, and the boot path
restarts from Entry. Valid images boot; invalid images usually end up back in the USB
bootloader.

Always Check BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_BOOTSEL_UART_BOOT to see if UART boot is
permitted.
UART boot disabled Go to Boot Failure.
Otherwise Outcome: Enter UART bootloader. The bootloader reboots once an image has been
downloaded, with a RAM_IMAGE boot type, and the boot path restarts from Entry. Valid
images boot; invalid images usually end up back in the UART bootloader.
Step: Boot Failure
Always Outcome: Take no further action. No valid boot image was discovered, and the selected
BOOTSEL interface was disabled. Attach the debugger to give the processor further
instruction. See the boot reason in boot RAM for diagnostics on why the boot failed.
5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 369

#####  TIP

```
The bootrom internally refers to BOOTSEL mode as NSBOOT, because the USB and UART bootloaders run in the
Non-secure state under Arm. This chapter may also occasionally refer to BOOTSEL as NSBOOT.

5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 370

##### 5.2.2.2. Differences between Arm and RISC-V

The boot sequence outlined in Table 451 has the following differences on RISC-V:

- Secure boot is not supported (from any image source).
- Anti-rollback checking is not supported as it applies only to secure boot.
- Additional security checks such as the use of the RCP to validate booleans are disabled.
- The UART and USB bootloaders continue to run in Machine mode, rather than transitioning from the Arm Secure to
    Non-secure state, meaning there is no hardware-enforced security boundary between these boot phases.
- The XIP setup function written to boot RAM on a successful flash boot contains RISC-V rather than Arm
    instructions.

#### 5.2.3. POWMAN boot vector

```
POWMAN contains scratch registers similar to the watchdog scratch registers, which persist over power-down of the
switched core power domain, in addition to most system resets. These registers allow users to install their own boot
handler, and divert control away from the main boot sequence on non-POR/BOR resets. It recognises the following
values written to BOOT0 through BOOT3:
```
- BOOT0: magic number^ 0xb007c0d
- BOOT1: Entry point XORed with magic^ -0xb007c0d3^ (0x4ff83f2d)
- BOOT2: Stack pointer
- BOOT3: Entry point
Use this to vector into code preloaded in RAM which was retained during a low-power state.
If either of the magic numbers mismatch, POWMAN vector boot does not take place. If the numbers match, the
bootrom zeroes BOOT0 before entering the vector, so that the behaviour does not persist over subsequent reboots.
The POWMAN boot vector is permitted to return. The boot sequence continues as normal after a return from POWMAN
vector boot, as though the vector boot had not taken place. There is no requirement for the vector to preserve the global
pointer (gp) register on RISC-V. Use this to perform any additional setup required for the boot path, such as issuing a
power-up command to an external QSPI device that may have been powered down (for example, through a B9h power-
down command).
The entry point (pc) must have the LSB set on Arm (the Thumb bit) and clear on RISC-V. If this condition is not met, the
bootrom assumes you have passed a RISC-V function pointer to an Arm processor (or vice versa) and hangs the core
rather than continuing, since executing code for the wrong architecture has spectacularly undefined consequences.
The linker should automatically set the Thumb bit appropriately for a function pointer relocation, but this is something to
be aware of if you pass hardcoded values such as the base of SRAM: this is correctly passed as 0x20000001 on Arm
(Thumb bit set) and 0x20000000 on RISC-V (no Thumb bit, halfword-aligned).

#### 5.2.4. Watchdog boot vector

```
Watchdog boot allows users to install their own boot handler, and divert control away from the main boot sequence on
non-POR/BOR resets. It recognises the following values written to the watchdog’s upper scratch registers:
```
- SCRATCH4: magic number^ 0xb007c0d
- SCRATCH5: entry point XORed with magic^ -0xb007c0d3^ (0x4ff83f2d)
- SCRATCH6: stack pointer
- SCRATCH7: entry point
If either of the magic numbers mismatch, watchdog boot does not take place. If the numbers match, the Bootrom
5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 371

```
zeroes SCRATCH4 before transferring control, so that the behaviour does not persist over subsequent reboots.
Watchdog boot can also be used to select the bootrom’s special one-shot boot modes, described in Section 5.2.4.1. The
term one-shot refers to the fact these only affect the next boot (and not subsequent ones) due to the bootrom clearing
SCRATCH4 each boot. These boot types are encoded by setting a special entry point (pc) value of 0xb007c0d3, which is
otherwise not a valid entry address, and then setting the boot type in the stack pointer (sp) value. Section 5.2.4.1 lists
the supported values.
The watchdog boot vector is permitted to return. The boot path continues as normal when it returns: use this to perform
any additional setup required for the boot path, such as issuing additional commands to an external QSPI device. On
RISC-V the vector is permitted to use its own global pointer (gp) value, as the bootrom only uses gp during USB boot,
which installs its own value.
With the exception of the magic boot type entry point (0xb007c0d3), the vector entry point pc must have the LSB set on
Arm (the Thumb bit) and clear on RISC-V. If this condition is not met, the bootrom assumes you have passed a RISC-V
function pointer to an Arm processor (or vice versa) and hangs the core rather than continuing.
```
##### 5.2.4.1. Special watchdog boot types

```
The magic entry point 0xb007c0d3 indicates a special one-shot boot type, identified by the stack pointer value:
BOOTSEL
Selected by sp = 2. Boot into BOOTSEL mode. This will be either UART or USB boot depending on whether QSPI SD
is driven high (default pull-down selects USB boot). See Section 5.2.8 for more details.
RAM_IMAGE
Selected by sp = 3. Boot into an image stored in SRAM or XIP SRAM. BOOTSEL mode uses this to request execution
of an image it loaded into RAM before rebooting. See Section 5.2.5 for more details.
FLASH_UPDATE
Selected by sp = 4. BOOTSEL selects this mode when rebooting following a flash download. Changes some flash
boot behaviour, such as allowing older versions to boot in preference to newer ones. See Section 5.1.16 for more
details.
Parameters to the one-shot boot type are passed in:
```
- SCRATCH2: Parameter 0
- SCRATCH3: Parameter 1
These directly correspond to the p0 and p1 boot parameters passed into the reboot() API. For example, on a RAM_IMAGE
boot, this specifies the base and size of the RAM region to be searched for a valid IMAGE_DEF. See the API listing in
Section 5.4.8.24 for more details. When not performing one of the listed boot types, SCRATCH2 and SCRATCH3 remain
free for arbitrary user values, and the bootrom doesn’t modify or interpret their contents.

#### 5.2.5. RAM image boot

The bootrom is directed (through values in the watchdog registers) to boot into an image in SRAM or XIP SRAM. The
two parameters indicate the start and size of the region to search for a block loop containing a valid (and correctly
signed if necessary) IMAGE_DEF. These are passed as parameter 0/1, in watchdog scratch 2/3.
If the image to be booted is contained in XIP SRAM, the XIP SRAM must be pinned in place by the bootrom prior to
launch. For this reason, if you are using XIP SRAM for your binaries, you must add a special entry to the LOAD_MAP item
(see Section 5.9.3.2).
5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 372

#### 5.2.6. OTP boot

```
If OTP boot is enabled, then code from OTP is executed in preference to code from flash. Note that the OTP code is free
to "chain" into an executable stored in flash.
Code from OTP is copied into SRAM at the specified location, then execution proceeds similarly to RAM Image Boot.
The SRAM with the data copied from OTP is searched for a valid (and correctly signed if necessary) IMAGE_DEF. If found, it
is booted; otherwise OTP boot falls through to Flash Boot (if enabled).
OTP boot could, for example, be used to execute some hidden decryption code to decode a flash image on startup. The
OTP boot code can hide itself (in OTP) even from Secure code, once it is done.
```
#### 5.2.7. Flash boot

The bootrom scans flash up to 16 times until it finds a valid IMAGE_DEF or PARTITION_TABLE. At this point, the flash settings
are considered valid, and the flash boot proceeds if a valid bootable IMAGE_DEF is found with these settings. It uses the
following combinations of flash read instruction and SCK divisor for the 16 attempts:

QSPI does not provide a reliable method to detect whether a device is attached. However, this is not much of an issue
for boot purposes: either there is a device with valid and bootable contents, or there are no such contents (either due to
lack of a connected device, invalid device contents, or failure to communicate in the current QSPI mode).
When there is no device (or no recognisable contents), the bootrom tries all 16 modes in Table 452 before finally giving
up. The size of the initial search region is limited to 4 kB to minimise the time spent scanning flash before falling
through to USB or UART boot. This same 4 kB limit also applies to search within a flash partition, which allows the
bootrom to reliably sever the contained image’s block loop with a single 4 kB sector erase at the start of a partition,
such as on a version downgrade.
There are three main ways that the bootrom locates flash images:
5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 373

```
Flash image boot
A flash image can be written directly to flash storage address 0x0, and the bootrom will find it from there. This is the
most similar to flash boot on RP2040 (the main differences being the removal of a boot2 in the first 256 bytes of the
image, and the new requirement for a valid image definition anywhere within the first 4 kB of the image).
Flash partition boot
A flash image can be written into a partition of a partition table. The partition table is described by a PARTITION_TABLE
block stored at the start of flash. The bootrom finds the partition table and scans its partitions to look for bootable
images.
Partition-table-in-image boot
A flash image containing an IMAGE_DEF and PARTITION_TABLE block in a single block loop is written to the start of flash.
The bootrom loads the embedded partition table, and enters the image in the same way as the flash image boot
case.
Revisit the linked bootrom concepts sections to get the fullest understanding of each of these three forms of flash boot.
For the purposes of this section, all that matters is whether the bootrom can discover a valid, bootable image or not. In
all three cases, the image must have a valid IMAGE_DEF, and meet all relevant security requirements such as being
correctly signed, and having a rollback version greater than or equal to the one stored in OTP.
The bootrom enters the flash image in whatever QSPI mode it discovered to work during flash programming. Any
further setup (such as prefixless continuous read modes) is performed by the flash image itself. This setup code,
referred to as an XIP setup function, is usually copied into RAM before execution to avoid running from flash whilst the
XIP interface is being reconfigured.
```
#####  TIP

```
The PICO_EMBED_XIP_SETUP=1 flag in the SDK enables inclusion and execution of an XIP setup function on RP2350
builds. In this case the function executes on the core 0 stack during early startup, so no additional static memory
need be allocated. This is not the case for subsequent calls, because the stack is often not executable post-startup.
You should save your XIP setup function in the first 256 bytes of boot RAM to make it easily locatable when the XIP
mode is re-initialised following a serial flash programming operation which had to drop out of XIP mode. The bootrom
writes a default XIP setup function to this address before entering the flash image, which restores the mode the
bootrom discovered during flash programming.
```
 (^) NOTE
You cannot execute an XIP setup function directly from boot RAM, because boot RAM is never executable. You must
copy it into SRAM before execution.
XIP setup functions should be fully position-independent, and no more than 256 bytes in size. If you are unable to meet
these requirements, you should install a stub function which calls your XIP setup function elsewhere in RAM.

#### 5.2.8. BOOTSEL (USB/UART) boot

```
The bootrom samples the state of QSPI CSn shortly after reset. Based on the result, the bootrom decides whether to
enter BOOTSEL mode, which refers collectively to the USB and UART bootloaders.
The bootrom initialises the chip select to the following state:
```
- Output disabled
- Pulled high (note^ CSn^ is an active-low signal, so this deselects the external QSPI device if there is one)
If the chip select remains high, the bootrom continues with its normal, non-BOOTSEL sequence. By default on a blank
device, this means driving the chip select low and attempting to boot from an external flash or PSRAM device.
If chip select is driven low externally, the bootrom enters BOOTSEL mode. You must drive the chip select low with a
5.2. Processor-controlled boot sequence 374

```
sufficiently low impedance to overcome the internal pull-up. A 4.7 kΩ resistance to ground is a good intermediate value
which reliably creates a low input logic level, but will not affect the output levels when RP2350 drives the chip select.
The QSPI SD1 line, which RP2350 initially pulls low, selects which bootloader to enter:
```
- SD1^ remains pulled low: enter USB bootloader
- SD1^ driven high: enter UART bootloader
USB boot is a low-friction method for programming an RP2350 from a sophisticated host like a Linux PC. It also directly
exposes more advanced options like OTP programming. See Section 5.5 for the drag-and-drop mass storage interface,
or Section 5.6 for the PICOBOOT vendor interface.
UART boot is a minimal interface for bootstrapping a flashless RP2350 from another microcontroller. UART boot uses
QSPI SD2 for UART TX, and QSPI SD3 for UART RX, at a fixed baud rate of 1 Mbaud. For more details about UART boot,
see Section 5.8.

##### 5.2.8.1. BOOTSEL clock requirements

```
BOOTSEL mode requires either a crystal attached across the XIN and XOUT pins, or a clock signal from an external
oscillator driven into the XIN pin. See Table 1439 for the electrical specifications of these two XOSC pins.
The bootrom assumes a default XOSC frequency of 12 MHz. It configures the USB PLL to derive a fixed 48 MHz
frequency from the XOSC reference. For USB, this must be a precise frequency. If you use a non-12 MHz crystal, and
intend to use USB boot, program BOOTSEL_PLL_CFG and BOOTSEL_XOSC_CFG in OTP, and then set
BOOT_FLAGS0.ENABLE_BOOTSEL_NON_DEFAULT_PLL_XOSC_CFG. For details about calculating the correct PLL
parameters for your crystal, see Section 8.6.3.
UART boot uses the same PLL configuration as USB boot. However, the permissible range of crystal frequencies under
the default PLL configuration is wider. See Section 5.8.1.
```
#### 5.2.9. Boot configuration (OTP)

```
User configuration stored in OTP can be found in Section 13.10, starting at CRIT1.
The main controls for the bootrom are stored in BOOT_FLAGS0 and BOOT_FLAGS1. These are both in page 1 of OTP,
which has the following default permissions on a blank device:
```
- Read-write for Secure (S)
- Read-write for bootloader (BL)
- Read-only for Non-secure (NS)
Boot key hashes are stored in page 2 of OTP, starting from BOOTKEY0_0. There is space for up to four boot key hashes
in this page. See Section 5.10.1 for an example of how keys can be installed.

## 5.3. Launching code on Processor Core 1

As described in Section 5.2, after reset, processor core 1 sleeps at start-up, and remains asleep until woken by core 0
via the SIO FIFOs.
If you are using the SDK then you can use the multicore_launch_core1() function to launch code on processor core 1.
However this section describes the procedure to launch code on processor core 1 yourself.
The procedure to start running on processor core 1 involves both cores moving in lockstep through a state machine
coordinated by passing messages over the inter-processor FIFOs. This state machine is designed to be robust enough
to cope with a recently reset processor core 1 which may be anywhere in its boot code, up to and including going to
sleep. As result, the procedure may be performed at any point after processor core 1 has been reset (either by system
5.3. Launching code on Processor Core 1 375

```
reset, or explicitly resetting just processor core 1).
The following C code describes the procedure:
// values to be sent in order over the FIFO from core 0 to core 1
//
// vector_table is value for VTOR register
// sp is initial stack pointer (SP)
// entry is the initial program counter (PC) (don't forget to set the thumb bit!)
const uint32_t cmd_sequence[] =
{0, 0, 1, (uintptr_t) vector_table, (uintptr_t) sp, (uintptr_t) entry};
uint seq = 0;
do {
uint cmd = cmd_sequence[seq];
// always drain the READ FIFO (from core 1) before sending a 0
if (!cmd) {
// discard data from read FIFO until empty
multicore_fifo_drain();
// execute a SEV as core 1 may be waiting for FIFO space
__sev();
}
// write 32 bit value to write FIFO
multicore_fifo_push_blocking(cmd);
// read 32 bit value from read FIFO once available
uint32_t response = multicore_fifo_pop_blocking();
// move to next state on correct response (echo-d value) otherwise start over
seq = cmd == response? seq + 1 : 0;
} while (seq < count_of(cmd_sequence));
```
## 5.4. Bootrom APIs

```
Whilst some ROM space is dedicated to the implementation of the boot sequence and USB/UART boot interfaces, the
bootrom also contains public functions that provide useful RP2350 functionality that may be useful for any code or
runtime running on the device.
A categorised list is available in Section 5.4.6.
The full alphabetical list is available in Section 5.4.7.
```
#### 5.4.1. Locating the API functions

The API functions are normally made available to the user by wrappers in the SDK. However, a lower level method is
provided to locate them (since their locations may change with each bootrom release) for other runtimes, or those who
wish to locate them directly.
Table 453 shows the fixed memory layout of certain words in the bootrom used to locate these functions when using
the Arm architecture. Table 454 shows the additional entries for use when using the RISC-V architecture.
Table 453. Bootrom

known) addresses for

0x00000016 16-bit pointer Pointer to a helper function (rom_table_lookup_val())
0x00000018 16-bit pointer Pointer to a helper function (rom_table_lookup_entry())
Table 454. Bootrom

known) addresses for

0x00007df8 16-bit pointer Pointer to a helper function (rom_table_lookup_val())
0x00007dfa 16-bit pointer Pointer to a helper function (rom_table_lookup_entry())
0x00007dfc 32-bit instruction RISC-V Entry Point
Assuming the three bytes starting at address 0x00000010 are ('M', 'u', 0x02), the other fixed location fields can be
assumed to be valid and used to lookup bootrom functionality.
The version byte at offset 0x00000013 is informational, and should not be used to infer the exact location of any
functions. It has the value 2 for A2 silicon.
The following code from the SDK shows how the SDK looks up a bootrom function:
static __force_inline void *rom_func_lookup_inline(uint32_t code) {
#ifdef __riscv
// on RISC-V the code (a jmp) is actually embedded in the table
rom_table_lookup_fn rom_table_lookup =
(rom_table_lookup_fn) (uintptr_t)*(uint16_t*)(BOOTROM_TABLE_LOOKUP_ENTRY_OFFSET
+ rom_offset_adjust);
return rom_table_lookup(code, RT_FLAG_FUNC_RISCV);
#else
// on Arm the function pointer is stored in the table, so we dereference it
// via lookup() rather than lookup_entry()
rom_table_lookup_fn rom_table_lookup =
(rom_table_lookup_fn) (uintptr_t)*(uint16_t*)(BOOTROM_TABLE_LOOKUP_OFFSET);
if (pico_processor_state_is_nonsecure()) {
return rom_table_lookup(code, RT_FLAG_FUNC_ARM_NONSEC);
} else {
return rom_table_lookup(code, RT_FLAG_FUNC_ARM_SEC);
}
#endif
}
As well as API functions, there are a few data values that can be looked up. The following code demonstrates:
void *rom_data_lookup(uint32_t code) {
rom_table_lookup_fn rom_table_lookup =
(rom_table_lookup_fn) (uintptr_t)*(uint16_t*)(BOOTROM_TABLE_LOOKUP_OFFSET);
return rom_table_lookup(code, RT_FLAG_DATA);
}
The code parameter correspond to the CODE values in the tables below, and is calculated as follows:
5.4. Bootrom APIs 377

```
uint32_t rom_table_code(char c1, char c2) {
return (c2 << 8) | c1;
}
These codes are also available in bootrom.h in the SDK as #defines.
```
#### 5.4.2. API function availability

```
Some functions are not available under all architectures or security levels. The API listing in Section 5.4.6 uses the
following terms to list the availability of each individual API entry point:
Arm-S
The function is available to Secure Arm code. The majority of functions are available for Arm-S unless they deal
specifically with RISC-V or Non-secure functionality.
RISC-V
The function is available to RISC-V code. Most of the functions that are available under Arm-S are also exposed
under RISC-V unless they deal specifically with Arm security states.
Arm-NS
The function is available to Non-secure Arm code. The function in this case performs additional permission and
argument checks to prevent Secure data from leaking or being corrupted.
Each individual Arm-NS API function must be explicitly enabled by Secure code before use, via set_ns_api_permission(). A
disabled Non-secure API returns BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED if disabled by Secure code. All Non-secure APIs are
disabled initially. There is no permission control on Non-secure code calling Secure-only Arm-S functions, but such a call
will crash when it attempts to access Secure-only hardware.
The Arm-NS functions may escalate through a Secure Gateway (SG) instruction to allow Non-secure code to perform
limited operations on nominally Secure-only hardware, such as QSPI direct-mode interface used for flash programming.
The RISC-V functions do not have separate entry points based on privilege level. Both M-mode and U-mode software can
call bootrom APIs, assuming they have execute permissions on ROM addresses in the PMP. However, U-mode calls will
crash if they attempt to access M-mode-only hardware.
```
#### 5.4.3. API function return codes

Some functions do not support returning any error, and are marked void. The remainder return either 0 (BOOTROM_OK) or a
positive value (if data needs to be returned) for success. These bootrom error codes are identical to the error codes
used by the SDK, so they can be used interchangeably. This explains the gaps in the numbering for SDK error codes that
aren’t used by the bootrom.
Name Value Description
value >= 0 The function succeeded and returned the value
BOOTROM_OK 0 The function executed successfully
BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED -4 The operation was disallowed by a security constraint
BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ARG -5 One or more parameters passed to the function is outside
the range of supported values;
BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS and
BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT are more specific
errors.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 378

```
Name Value Description
BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS -10 An address argument was out-of-bounds or was
determined to be an address that the caller may not
access.
BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT -11 An address passed to the function was not correctly
aligned.
BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE -12 Something happened or failed to happen in the past, and
consequently the request cannot currently be serviced.
BOOTROM_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL -13 A user-allocated buffer was too small to hold the result or
working state of the function.
BOOTROM_ERROR_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET -14 The call failed because another bootrom function must be
called first.
BOOTROM_ERROR_MODIFIED_DATA -15 Cached data was determined to be inconsistent with the
full version of the data it was copied from.
BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_DATA -16 The contents of a data structure are invalid
BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_FOUND -17 An attempt was made to access something that does not
exist; or, a search failed.
BOOTROM_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_MODIFICATION -18 Modification is impossible based on current state. This
might occur, for example, when attempting to clear an
OTP bit.
BOOTROM_ERROR_LOCK_REQUIRED -19 A required lock is not owned. See Section 5.4.4.
```
#### 5.4.4. API functions and exclusive access

Various bootrom functions require access to parts of the system which:

- cannot be safely accessed by both cores at once, or
- limit the functionality of other hardware when in use
For example:
- Programming OTP: it is not possible to read from the memory mapped OTP data regions at the same time as
accessing its serial programming interface.
- Use of the SHA-256 block: only one SHA-256 sum can be in progress at a time.
- Using the QSPI direct-mode interface to program the flash causes XIP access to return a bus fault.
It is beyond the purview of the bootrom to implement a locking strategy, as the style and scope of the locking required
is entirely up to how the application itself uses these resources.
Nevertheless, it is important that, say, a Non-secure call to a flash programming API can’t cause a hard fault in other
Secure code running from flash. There must be some way for user software to coordinate with bootrom APIs on such
changes of state. The bootrom implements the mechanism but not the policy for mutual exclusion over bootrom API
calls.
The solution the bootrom provides is to use the boot locks (boot RAM registers BOOTLOCK0 through BOOTLOCK7) to
inform the bootrom which resources are currently owned by the caller and therefore safe for it to use.
To enable lock checking in bootrom APIs, set boot lock 7 (LOCK_ENABLE) to the claimed state. When enabled, bootrom
functions which use certain hardware resources (listed below) will check the status of the boot lock assigned to that
resource, and return BOOTROM_ERROR_LOCK_REQUIRED if that lock is not in the claimed state.
Before calling a bootrom function with locking enabled, you must claim the relevant locks. It may take multiple attempts
5.4. Bootrom APIs 379

```
to claim if the API is concurrently accessed from other contexts. Follow the same steps as the SIO spinlocks (Section
3.1.4) to claim a lock.
The following boot locks are assigned:
```
- 0x0^ :^ LOCK_SHA_256^ - if owned, then a bootrom API is allowed to use the SHA-256 block
- 0x1^ :^ LOCK_FLASH_OP^ - if owned, then a bootrom API is allowed to enter direct mode on the QSPI memory interface
    (Section 12.14.5) in order to perform low-level flash operations
- 0x2^ :^ LOCK_OTP^ - if owned, then a bootrom API is allowed to access OTP via the serial interface
- 0x7^ :^ LOCK_ENABLE^ - if owned, then bootrom API resource ownership checking is enabled. This is off by default, since
    the bootrom APIs aim to be usable by default without additional setup.

#### 5.4.5. SDK access to the API

```
Bootrom functions are exposed in the SDK via the pico_bootrom library (see pico_bootrom).
Each bootrom function has a rom_ wrapper function that looks up the bootrom function address and calls it.
The SDK provides a simple implementation of exclusive access via bootrom_acquire_lock_blocking(n) and
bootrom_release_lock(n). When enabled, as it is by default (PICO_BOOTROM_LOCKING_ENABLED=1 is defined) the SDK enables
bootrom locking via LOCK_ENABLE, and these two functions use the other SHA_256/FLASH_OP/OTP boot locks to take ownership
of/release ownership of the corresponding bootrom resource.
The rom_ wrapper functions the SDK call bootrom_acquire_lock_locking and bootrom_relead_lock functions around bootrom
calls that have locking requirements.
```
#### 5.4.6. Categorised list of API functions and ROM data

```
The terms in parentheses after each function name (Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V) indicate the architecture and security state
combinations where that API is available:
```
- Arm-S: Arm processors running in the Secure state
- Arm-NS: Arm processors running in the Non-secure state
- RISC-V: RISC-V processors
See Section 5.4.2 for the full definitions of these terms.
List entries ending with parentheses, such as flash_op(), are callable functions. List entries without parentheses, such
as git_revision, are pointers to ROM data locations.

##### 5.4.6.1. Low-level Flash access

These low-level (Secure-only) flash access functions are similar to the ones on RP2040:

- connect_internal_flash() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- flash_enter_cmd_xip() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- flash_exit_xip() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- flash_flush_cache() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- flash_range_erase() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- flash_range_program() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
These are new with RP2350:
5.4. Bootrom APIs 380

- flash_reset_address_trans() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- flash_select_xip_read_mode() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.2. High-level flash access

```
The higher level access functions, provide functionality that is safe to expose (with permissions) to Non-secure code as
well.
```
- flash_op() (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS,^ RISC-V)
- flash_runtime_to_storage_addr() (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.3. System information

- flash_devinfo16_ptr (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- get_partition_table_info() (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS^ RISC-V)
- get_sys_info() (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS,^ RISC-V)
- git_revision (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.4. Partition tables

- get_b_partition() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- get_uf2_target_partition() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- pick_ab_partition() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- partition_table_ptr (Arm-S`,^ RISC-V)
- load_partition_table() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.5. Bootrom memory and state

- set_bootrom_stack() (RISC-V)
- xip_setup_func_ptr (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- bootrom_state_reset() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.6. Executable image management

- chain_image() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- (explicit_buy() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.7. Security

These Secure-only functions control access for Non-secure code:

- set_ns_api_permission() (Arm-S)
- set_rom_callback() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
- validate_ns_buffer() (Arm-S,^ RISC-V)
5.4. Bootrom APIs 381

##### 5.4.6.8. Miscellaneous

```
These functions are provided to all platforms and security levels, but perform additional checks when called from Non-
secure Arm code:
```
- reboot() (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS,^ RISC-V)
- otp_access() (Arm-S,^ Arm-NS,^ RISC-V)

##### 5.4.6.9. Non-secure only

- secure_call() (Arm-NS)

##### 5.4.6.10. Bit manipulation

```
Unlike RP2040, the bootrom doesn’t contain bit manipulation functions. Processors on RP2350 implement hardware
instructions for these operations which are far faster than the software implementations in the RP2040 bootrom.
```
##### 5.4.6.11. Memcpy and Memset

```
Unlike RP2040, the bootrom doesn’t provide memory copy or clearing functions, as your language runtime is expected
to already provide well-performing implementations of these on Cortex-M33 or Hazard3.
The bootrom does contain private implementations of standard C memcpy() and memset(), for both Arm and RISC-V, but
these are optimised for size rather than performance. They are not exported in the ROM table.
```
##### 5.4.6.12. Floating point

```
Unlike RP2040 the bootrom doesn’t contain functions for floating point arithmetic. On Arm there is standard processor
support for single-precision arithmetic via the Cortex-M FPU, and RP2350 provides an Arm coprocessor which
dramatically accelerates double-precision arithmetic (the DCP, Section 3.6.2). The SDK defaults to the most performant
hardware or software implementation available.
```

#### 5.4.8. API function listings

##### 5.4.8.1. bootrom_state_reset

```
Code: 'S','R'
Signature: void bootrom_state_reset(uint32_t flags)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Resets internal bootrom state, based on the following flags:
```
- 0x0001^ :^ STATE_RESET_CURRENT_CORE^ - Resets any internal bootrom state for the current core to a known state. This
    method should be called prior to calling any other bootrom APIs on the current core, and is called automatically by
    the bootrom during normal boot of core 0 or launch of code on core 1.
- 0x0002^ :^ STATE_RESET_OTHER_CORE^ - Resets any internal bootrom state for the other core into a clean state. This is
    generally called by a debugger when resetting the state of one core via code running on the other.
- 0x0004^ :^ STATE_RESET_GLOBAL_STATE^ - Resets all non core-specific state, including:

### ◦ Disables access to bootrom APIs from^ Arm-NS^ (see also set_ns_api_permission()).

### ◦ Unlocks all boot locks (Section 5.4.4).

### ◦ Clears any Secure code callbacks. (see also set_rom_callback())

Note that the SDK calls this method on runtime initialisation to put the boot RO into a known state. This allows the
program to function correctly if it is entered via a debugger, or otherwise without taking the usual boot path through the
bootrom, which itself would reset the state.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 383

##### 5.4.8.2. chain_image

```
Code: 'C','I'
Signature: int chain_image(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, int32_t region_base, uint32_t region_size)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function may require additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, or a negative error code on error.
Searches a memory region for a launchable image, and executes it if possible.
The region_base and region_size specify a word-aligned, word-multiple-sized area of RAM, XIP RAM or flash to search.
The first 4 kB of the region must contain the start of a block loop with an IMAGE_DEF. If the new image is launched, the call
does not return otherwise an error is returned.
The region_base is signed, as a negative value can be passed, which indicates that the (negated back to positive value) is
both the region_base and the base of the "flash update" region.
This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking
signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should be word
aligned, and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT / BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The
work area size currently required is 3064, so 3 kB is a good choice.
This method is primarily expected to be used when implementing bootloaders.
```
 (^) NOTE
When chaining into an image, the BOOT_FLAGS0.ROLLBACK_REQUIRED flag will not be set, to prevent invalidating a
bootloader without a rollback version by booting a binary which has one (see Section 5.10.8).

##### 5.4.8.3. connect_internal_flash

```
Code: 'I','F'
Signature: void connect_internal_flash(void)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Restores all QSPI pad controls to their default state, and connects the QMI peripheral to the QSPI pads.
If a secondary flash chip select GPIO has been configured via OTP FLASH_DEVINFO, or by writing to the runtime copy of
FLASH_DEVINFO in boot RAM, then this bank 0 GPIO is also initialised and the QMI peripheral is connected. Otherwise, bank
0 IOs are untouched.
```
##### 5.4.8.4. explicit_buy

```
Code: 'E','B'
Signature: int explicit_buy(uint8_t *buffer, uint32_t buffer_size)
Supported architectures: Arm-S RISC-V
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, negative error code on error.
Perform an "explicit buy" of an executable launched via an IMAGE_DEF which was TBYB (Section 5.1.17) flagged. A "flash
update" boot of such an image is a way to have the image execute once, but only become the "current" image if it safely
calls back into the bootrom via this call.
This call may perform the following:
```
- Erase and rewrite the part of flash containing the TBYB flag in order to clear said flag.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 384

- Erase the first sector of the other partition in an A/B partition scenario, if this new^ IMAGE_DEF^ is a version downgrade
    (so this image will boot again when not doing a normal boot)
- Update the rollback version in OTP if the chip is secure, and a rollback version is present in the image.
The first of the above requires 4 kB of scratch space, so you should pass a word aligned buffer of at least 4 kB to this
method in this case, or BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT / BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned.
The device might reboot while updating the rollback version if multiple rollback rows need to be written. This occurs
when the version crosses a multiple of 24 (for example, upgrading from version 23 to 25 requires a reboot, but 23 to 24
or 24 to 25 doesn’t). The application must therefore be prepared to reboot when calling this function if rollback versions
are in use.

##### 5.4.8.5. flash_devinfo16-ptr

```
Code: 'F','D'
Type: uint16_t *flash_devinfo16_ptr
Pointer to the flash device info used by the flash APIs, for example, for bounds checking against size of flash devices,
and configuring the GPIO used for secondary QSPI chip select.
If BOOT_FLAGS0.FLASH_DEVINFO_ENABLE is set, this boot RAM location is initialised from FLASH_DEVINFO at startup,
otherwise it is initialised to:
```
- Chip select 0 size: 16 MB
- Chip select 1 size: 0 bytes
- No chip select 1 GPIO
- No D8h erase command support
The flash APIs use this boot RAM copy of FLASH_DEVINFO, so flash device info can updated by Secure code at runtime by
writing through this pointer.

##### 5.4.8.6. flash_enter_cmd_xip

```
Code: 'C','X'
Signature: void flash_enter_cmd_xip(void)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Compatibility alias for flash_select_xip_read_mode(0, 12);.
Configure the QMI to generate a standard 03h serial read command, with 24 address bits, upon each XIP access. This is
a slow XIP configuration, but is widely supported. CLKDIV is set to 12. The debugger may call this function to ensure
that flash is readable following a program/erase operation.
Note that the same setup is performed by flash_exit_xip(), and the RP2350 flash program/erase functions do not leave
XIP in an inaccessible state, so calls to this function are largely redundant. It is provided for compatibility with RP2040.
```
##### 5.4.8.7. flash_exit_xip

Code: 'E','X'
Signature: void flash_exit_xip(void)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Initialise the QMI for serial operations (direct mode), and also initialise a basic XIP mode, where the QMI will perform
03h serial read commands at low speed (CLKDIV=12) in response to XIP reads.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 385

```
Then, issue a sequence to the QSPI device on chip select 0, designed to return it from continuous read mode ("XIP
mode") and/or QPI mode to a state where it will accept serial commands. This is necessary after system reset to
restore the QSPI device to a known state, because resetting RP2350 does not reset attached QSPI devices. It is also
necessary when user code, having already performed some continuous-read-mode or QPI-mode accesses, wishes to
return the QSPI device to a state where it will accept the serial erase and programming commands issued by the
bootrom’s flash access functions.
If a GPIO for the secondary chip select is configured via FLASH_DEVINFO, then the XIP exit sequence is also issued to chip
select 1.
The QSPI device should be accessible for XIP reads after calling this function; the name flash_exit_xip refers to
returning the QSPI device from its XIP state to a serial command state.
```
##### 5.4.8.8. flash_flush_cache

```
Code: 'F','C'
Signature: void flash_flush_cache(void)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Flush the entire XIP cache, by issuing an invalidate by set/way maintenance operation to every cache line (Section
4.4.1). This ensures that flash program/erase operations are visible to subsequent cached XIP reads.
Note that this unpins pinned cache lines, which may interfere with cache-as-SRAM use of the XIP cache.
No other operations are performed.
```
##### 5.4.8.9. flash_op

Code: 'F','O'
Signature: int flash_op(uint32_t flags, uint32_t addr, uint32_t size_bytes, uint8_t *buf)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, negative error code on error.
Perform a flash read, erase, or program operation. Erase operations must be sector-aligned (4096 bytes) and sector-
multiple-sized, and program operations must be page-aligned (256 bytes) and page-multiple-sized; misaligned erase
and program operations will return BOOTROM_ERROR_BAD_ALIGNMENT. The operation — erase, read, program — is selected by
the CFLASH_OP_BITS bitfield of the flags argument:
flags is comprised of the following values:
Address Translation (select one)
0x00000000 No address translation; addr arg is the actual flash storage addresses.
0x00000001 Runtime address translation; addr arg is XIP memory address affected by address translation.
Security level (select one)
0x00000100 Perform the operation using secure permissions. This is disallowed for a non-secure caller.
0x00000200 Perform the operation using non-secure permissions.
0x00000300 Perform the operation using boot-loader permissions. This is disallowed for a non-secure
caller.
Operation (select one)
0x00000000 Erase size_bytes bytes of flash, starting at address addr. Both addr and size_bytes must be a
multiple of 4096 bytes (one flash sector).
5.4. Bootrom APIs 386

0x00010000 (^) Program size_bytes bytes of flash, starting at address addr. Both addr and size_bytes must be a
multiple of 256 bytes (one flash page).
0x00020000 Read size_bytes bytes of flash, starting at address addr. There are no alignment restrictions on
addr or size_bytes.
These constants are also available in bootrom_constants.h in the SDK as #defines.
addr is the address of the first flash byte to be accessed, ranging from XIP_BASE to XIP_BASE + 0x1ffffff inclusive. This may
be a runtime or storage address. buf contains data to be written to flash, for program operations, and data read back
from flash, for read operations. buf is never written by program operations, and is completely ignored for erase
operations.
The flash operation is bounds-checked against the known flash devices specified by the runtime value of FLASH_DEVINFO,
stored in boot RAM. This is initialised by the bootrom to the OTP value FLASH_DEVINFO, if
BOOT_FLAGS0.FLASH_DEVINFO_ENABLE is set; otherwise it is initialised to 16 MB for chip select 0 and 0 bytes for chip
select 1. FLASH_DEVINFO can be updated at runtime by writing to its location in boot RAM, the pointer to which can be
looked up in the ROM table.
If a resident partition table is in effect, then the flash operation is also checked against the partition permissions. The
Secure version of this function can specify the caller’s effective security level (Secure, Non-secure, bootloader) using
the CFLASH_SECLEVEL_BITS bitfield of the flags argument, whereas the Non-secure function is always checked against the
Non-secure permissions for the partition. Flash operations which span two partitions are not allowed, and will fail
address validation.
If FLASH_DEVINFO.D8H_ERASE_SUPPORTED is set, erase operations will use a D8h 64 kB block erase command where
possible (without erasing outside the specified region), for faster erase time. Otherwise, only 20h 4 kB sector erase
commands are used.
Optionally, this API can translate addr from flash runtime addresses to flash storage addresses, according to the
translation currently configured by QMI address translation registers, ATRANS0 through ATRANS7. For example, an
image stored at a +2 MB offset in flash (but mapped at XIP address 0 at runtime), writing to an offset of +1 MB into the
image, will write to a physical flash storage address of 3 MB. Translation is enabled by setting the corresponding bitfield
in the flags argument.
When translation is enabled, flash operations that cross address holes in the XIP runtime address space (created by
non-maximum ATRANSx_SIZE) will return an error response. This check may tear: the transfer may be partially performed
before encountering an address hole and ultimately returning failure.
When translation is enabled, flash operations are permitted to cross chip select boundaries, provided this does not span
an ATRANS address hole. When translation is disabled, the entire operation must target a single flash chip select (as
determined by bits 24 and upward of the address), else address validation will fail.
A typical call sequence for erasing a flash sector in the runtime address space from Secure code would be:

- connect_internal_flash();
- flash_exit_xip();
- flash_op((CFLASH_OP_VALUE_ERASE << CFLASH_OP_LSB) | (CFLASH_SECLEVEL_VALUE_SECURE << CFLASH_SECLEVEL_LSB) |
    (CFLASH_ASPACE_VALUE_RUNTIME << CFLASH_ASPACE_LSB), addr, 4096, NULL);
- flash_flush_cache();
- Copy the XIP setup function from boot RAM to SRAM and execute it, to restore the original XIP mode

### ◦ The bootrom will have written a default setup function which restores the mode/clkdiv parameters found

during flash search; user code can overwrite this with its own custom setup function.
A similar sequence is required for program operations. Read operations can leave the current XIP mode in effect, so
only the flash_op(...); call is required.
Note that the RP2350 bootrom leaves the flash in a basic XIP state in between program/erase operations. However,
during a program/erase operation, the QMI is in direct mode (Section 12.14.5) and any attempted XIP access will return
5.4. Bootrom APIs 387

a bus error response.

##### 5.4.8.10. flash_range_erase

```
Code: 'R','E'
Signature: void flash_range_erase(uint32_t addr, size_t count, uint32_t block_size, uint8_t block_cmd)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Erase count bytes, starting at addr (offset from start of flash). Optionally, pass a block erase command (for example, D8h
block erase), and the size of the block erased by this command — this function will use the larger block erase where
possible, for much higher erase speed. addr must be aligned to a 4096-byte sector, and count must be a multiple of 4096
bytes.
This is a low-level flash API, and no validation of the arguments is performed. See flash_op() for a higher-level API which
checks alignment, flash bounds and partition permissions, and can transparently apply a runtime-to-storage address
translation.
The QSPI device must be in a serial command state before calling this API, which can be achieved by calling
connect_internal_flash() followed by flash_exit_xip(). After the erase, the flash cache should be flushed via
flash_flush_cache() to ensure the modified flash data is visible to cached XIP accesses.
Finally, the original XIP mode should be restored by copying the saved XIP setup function from boot RAM into SRAM,
and executing it: the bootrom provides a default function which restores the flash mode/clkdiv discovered during flash
scanning, and user programs can override this with their own XIP setup function.
For the duration of the erase operation, QMI is in direct mode (Section 12.14.5) and attempting to access XIP from
DMA, the debugger or the other core will return a bus fault. XIP becomes accessible again once the function returns.
```
##### 5.4.8.11. flash_range_program

```
Code: 'R','P'
Signature: void flash_range_program(uint32_t addr, const uint8_t *data, size_t count)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Program data to a range of flash storage addresses starting at addr (offset from the start of flash) and count bytes in
size. addr must be aligned to a 256-byte boundary, and count must be a multiple of 256.
This is a low-level flash API, and no validation of the arguments is performed. See flash_op() for a higher-level API which
checks alignment, flash bounds and partition permissions, and can transparently apply a runtime-to-storage address
translation.
The QSPI device must be in a serial command state before calling this API — see notes on flash_range_erase().
```
##### 5.4.8.12. flash_reset_address_trans

Code: 'R','A'
Signature: void flash_reset_address_trans(void)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Restore the QMI address translation registers, ATRANS0 through ATRANS7, to their reset state. This makes the runtime-
to-storage address map an identity map, meaning the mapped and unmapped address are equal, and the entire space is
fully mapped. See Section 12.14.4.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 388

##### 5.4.8.13. flash_runtime_to_storage_addr

```
Code: 'F','A'
Signature: int flash_runtime_to_storage_addr(uint32_t addr)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V
Returns: A positive value on success (the translated address), or negative error code on error
Applies the address translation currently configured by QMI address translation registers, ATRANS0 through ATRANS7.
See Section 12.14.4.
Translating an address outside of the XIP runtime address window, or beyond the bounds of an ATRANSx_SIZE field,
returns BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS, which is not a valid flash storage address. Otherwise, return the storage address
which QMI would access when presented with the runtime address addr. This is effectively a virtual-to-physical address
translation for QMI.
```
##### 5.4.8.14. flash_select_xip_read_mode

```
Code: 'X','M'
Signature: void flash_select_xip_read_mode(bootrom_xip_mode_t mode, uint8_t clkdiv)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Configure QMI for one of a small menu of XIP read modes supported by the bootrom. This mode is configured for both
memory windows (both chip selects), and the clock divisor is also applied to direct mode.
The available modes are:
```
- 0 : 03h serial read: serial address, serial data, no wait cycles
- 1 : 0Bh serial read: serial address, serial data, 8 wait cycles
- 2 : BBh dual-IO read: dual address, dual data, 4 wait cycles (including MODE bits, which are driven to 0)
- 3 : EBh quad-IO read: quad address, quad data, 6 wait cycles (including MODE bits, which are driven to 0)
The XIP write command/format are not configured by this function.
When booting from flash, the bootrom tries each of these modes in turn, from 3 down to 0. The first mode that is found
to work is remembered, and a default XIP setup function is written into boot RAM that calls this function
(flash_select_xip_read_mode) with the parameters discovered during flash scanning. This can be called at any time to
restore the flash parameters discovered during flash boot.
All XIP modes configured by the bootrom have an 8-bit serial command prefix, so that the flash device can remain in a
serial command state, meaning XIP accesses can be mixed more freely with program/erase serial operations. This has
a performance penalty, so users can perform their own flash setup after flash boot using continuous read mode or QPI
mode to avoid or alleviate the command prefix cost.

##### 5.4.8.15. get_b_partition

Code: 'G','B'
Signature: int get_b_partition(uint partition_a)
Supported architectures: Arm-S RISC-V
Returns: The index of the B partition of partition A if a partition table is present and loaded, and there is a partition A with
a corresponding B partition; otherwise returns BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_FOUND.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 389

##### 5.4.8.16. get_partition_table_info

```
Code: 'G','P'
Signature: int get_partition_table_info(uint32_t *out_buffer, uint32_t out_buffer_word_size, uint32_t flags_and_partition)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V
Returns: >= 0 on success (the number of words filled in out_buffer), negative error code on error.
Fills a buffer with information from the partition table. Note that this API is also used to return information over the
PICOBOOT interface.
On success, the buffer is filled, and the number of words filled in the buffer is returned. If the partition table hasn’t been
loaded (for example, from a watchdog or RAM boot), this method returns BOOTROM_ERROR_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET, and you
should load the partition table through load_partition_table() first.
Not all data from the partition table is kept resident in memory by the bootrom due to size constraints. To protect
against changes being made in flash after the bootrom has loaded the resident portion, the bootrom keeps a hash of
the partition table as of the time it loaded it. If the hash has changed by the time this method is called, then it will return
BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE.
The information returned is chosen by the flags_and_partition parameter; the first word in the returned buffer, is the
(sub)set of those flags that the API supports. You should always check this value before interpreting the buffer.
Following the first word, returns words of data for each present flag in order. With the exception of PT_INFO, all the flags
select "per partition" information, so each field is returned in flag order for one partition after the next. The special
SINGLE_PARTITION flag indicates that data for only a single partition is required. Flags include:
```
- 0x0001^ -^ PT_INFO^ : information about the partition table as a whole. The second two words for unpartitioned space in
    the same form described in Section 5.9.4.2.

### ◦ Word 0 :^ partition_count^ (low 8 bits),^ partition_table_present^ (bit 8)

### ◦ Word 1 :^ unpartitioned_space_permissions_and_location

### ◦ Word 2 :^ unpartitioned_space_permissions_and_flags

- 0x8000^ -^ SINGLE_PARTITION^ : only return data for a single partition; the partition number is stored in the top 8 bits of
    flags_and_partition
Per-partition fields:
- 0x0010^ -^ PARTITION_LOCATION_AND_FLAGS^ : the core information about a partition. The format of these fields is described
in Section 5.9.4.2.

### ◦ Word 0 -^ permissions_and_location

### ◦ Word 1 -^ permissions_and_flags

- 0x0020^ -^ PARTITION_ID^ : the optional 64-bit identifier for the partition. If the^ HAS_ID^ bit is set in the partition flags, then
    the 64 bit ID is returned:

### ◦ Word 0 - first 32 bits

### ◦ Word 1 - second 32 bits

- 0x0040^ -^ PARTITION_FAMILY_IDS^ : Any additional UF2 family IDs that the partition supports being downloaded into it via
    the MSD bootloader beyond the standard ones flagged in the permissions_and_flags field (see Section 5.9.4.2).
- 0x0080^ -^ PARTITION_NAME^ : The optional name for the partition. If the^ HAS_NAME^ field bit in^ permissions_and_flags^ is not set,
    then no data is returned for this partition; otherwise the format is as follows:

### ◦ Byte 0 : 7 bit length of the name (LEN); top bit reserved

### ◦ Byte 1 : first character of name

### ◦ ...

5.4. Bootrom APIs 390

### ◦ Byte LEN : last character of name

### ◦ ...^ (padded up to the next word boundary)

#####  NOTE

```
Unpartitioned space is always reported in Word 1 as having a base offset of 0x0 and a size of 0x2000 sectors (32 MB).
The bootrom applies unpartitioned space permissions to any flash storage address that is not covered by a partition.
```
##### 5.4.8.17. get_sys_info

```
Code: 'G','S'
Signature: int get_sys_info(uint32_t *out_buffer, uint32_t out_buffer_word_size, uint32_t flags)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V
Returns: A positive value on success (the number of words filled in out_buffer), negative error code on error.
Fills a buffer with various system information. Note that this API is also used to return information over the PICOBOOT
interface.
The information returned is chosen by the flags parameter; the first word in the returned buffer, is the (sub)set of those
flags that the API supports. You should always check this value before interpreting the buffer.
Following the first word, returns words of data for each present flag in order:
```
- 0x0001^ :^ CHIP_INFO^ - unique identifier for the chip (3 words)

### ◦ Word 0 : Value of the^ CHIP_INFO_PACKAGE_SEL^ register

### ◦ Word 1 : RP2350 device id low

### ◦ Word 2 : RP2350 device id high

- 0x0002^ :^ CRITICAL^ (1 word)

### ◦ Word 0 : Value of the OTP CRITICAL register, containing critical boot flags read out on last OTP reset event

- 0x0004^ :^ CPU_INFO^ (1 word)

### ◦ Word 0 : Current CPU architecture

```
▪ 0 - Arm
▪ 1 - RISC-V
```
- 0x0008^ :^ FLASH_DEV_INFO^ (1 word)

### ◦ Word 0 : Flash device info in the format of OTP FLASH_DEVINFO

- 0x0010^ :^ BOOT_RANDOM^ - a 128-bit random number generated on each boot (4 words)

### ◦ Word 0 : Per boot random number 0

### ◦ Word 1 : Per boot random number 1

### ◦ Word 2 : Per boot random number 2

### ◦ Word 3 : Per boot random number 3

- 0x0020^ :^ NONCE^ - not supported
- 0x0040^ :^ BOOT_INFO^ (4 words)

### ◦ Word 0 :^ 0xttppbbdd

▪ tt^ - recent boot TBYB and update info (updated on regular non BOOTSEL boots)
5.4. Bootrom APIs 391

```
▪ pp - recent boot partition (updated on regular not BOOTSEL boots)
▪ bb^ - boot type of the most recent boot
▪ dd^ - recent boot diagnostic "partition"
```
### ◦ Word 1 : Recent boot diagnostic. Diagnostic information from a recent boot (with information from the

```
partition (or slot) indicated by dd above. "partition" numbers here are:
▪ 0-15 : a partition number
▪ -1 : none
▪ -2 : slot 0
▪ -3 : slot 1
▪ -4 : image (the diagnostic came from the launch of a RAM image, OTP boot image or user^ chain_image()
call).
```
### ◦ Word 2 : Last reboot param 0

### ◦ Word 3 : Last reboot param 1

```
"Boot Diagnostic" information is intended to help identify the cause of a failed boot, or booting into an unexpected
binary. This information can be retrieved via PICOBOOT after a watchdog reboot, however it will not survive a reset via
the RUN pin or POWMAN reset.
There is only one word of diagnostic information. What it records is based on the pp selection above, which is itself set
as a parameter when rebooting programmatically into a normal boot.
To get diagnostic info, pp must refer to a slot or an "A" partition; image diagnostics are automatically selected on boot
from OTP or RAM image, or when chain_image() is called.)
The diagnostic word thus contains data for either slot 0 and slot 1, or the "A" partition (and its "B" partition if it has one).
The low half word of the diagnostic word contains information from slot 0 or partition A; the high half word contains
information from slot 1 or partition B.
The format of each half-word is as follows (using the word region to refer to slot or partition)
```
- 0x0001^ :^ REGION_SEARCHED^ - The region was searched for a block loop.
- 0x0002^ :^ INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP^ - A block loop was found but it was invalid
- 0x0004^ :^ VALID_BLOCK_LOOP^ - A valid block loop was found (Blocks from a loop wholly contained within the region, and
    the blocks have the correct structure. Each block consists of items whose sizes sum to the size of the block)
- 0x0008^ :^ VALID_IMAGE_DEF^ - A valid^ IMAGE_DEF^ was found in the region. A valid^ IMAGE_DEF^ must parse correctly and must
    be executable.
- 0x0010^ :^ HAS_PARTITION_TABLE^ - Whether a partition table is present. This partition table must have a correct structure
    formed if VALID_BLOCK_LOOP is set. If the partition table turns out to be invalid, then INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP is set too (thus
    both VALID_BLOCK_LOOP and INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP will both be set).
- 0x0020^ : CONSIDERED - There was a choice of partition/slot and this one was considered. The first slot/partition is
    chosen based on a number of factors. If the first choice fails verification, then the other choice will be considered.

### ◦ the version of the^ PARTITION_TABLE/IMAGE_DEF^ present in the slot/partition respectively.

### ◦ whether the slot/partition is the "update region" as per a^ FLASH_UPDATE^ reboot.

### ◦ whether an^ IMAGE_DEF^ is marked as "explicit buy"

- 0x0040^ :^ CHOSEN^ - This slot/partition was chosen (or was the only choice)
- 0x0080^ :^ PARTITION_TABLE_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY^ - if a signature is required for the^ PARTITION_TABLE^ (via OTP setting),
    then whether the PARTITION_TABLE is signed with a key matching one of the four stored in OTP
- 0x0100^ :^ PARTITION_TABLE_HASH_FOR_VERIFY^ - set if a hash value check could be performed. In the case a signature is
    required, this value is identical to PARTITION_TABLE_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY
5.4. Bootrom APIs 392

- 0x0200^ :^ PARTITION_TABLE_VERIFIED_OK^ - whether the^ PARTITION_TABLE^ passed verification (signature/hash if

- 0x0400^ :^ IMAGE_DEF_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY^ - if a signature is required for the^ IMAGE_DEF^ due to secure boot, then
    whether the IMAGE_DEF is signed with a key matching one of the four stored in OTP.
- 0x0800^ :^ IMAGE_DEF_HASH_FOR_VERIFY^ - set if a hash value check could be performed. In the case a signature is required,
    this value is identical to IMAGE_DEF_MATCHING_KEY_FOR_VERIFY
- 0x1000^ :^ IMAGE_DEF_VERIFIED_OK^ - whether the^ PARTITION_TABLE^ passed verification (signature/hash if present/required)

- 0x4000^ :^ IMAGE_LAUNCHED^ - whether an^ IMAGE_DEF^ from this region was launched
- 0x8000^ :^ IMAGE_CONDITION_FAILURE^ - whether the^ IMAGE_DEF^ failed final checks before launching; these checks include:

### ◦ verification failed (if it hasn’t been verified earlier in the^ CONSIDERED^ phase).

### ◦ a problem occurred setting up any rolling window.

### ◦ the rollback version could not be set in OTP (if required in Secure mode)

### ◦ the image was marked as Non-secure

### ◦ the image was marked as "explicit buy", and this was a flash boot, but then region was not the "flash update"

region

### ◦ the image has the wrong architecture, but architecture auto-switch is disabled (or the correct architecture is

disabled)

 (^) NOTE
The non-sensical combination of BOOT_DIAGNOSTIC_INVALID_BLOCK_LOOP and BOOT_DIAGNOSTIC_VALID_BLOCK_LOOP both being
set is used to flag a PARTITION_TABLE which passed the initial verification (and hash/sig), but was later discovered to
have invalid contents when it was fully parsed.
To get a full picture of a failed boot involving slots and multiple partitions, the device can be rebooted multiple times to
gather the information.

##### 5.4.8.18. get_uf2_target_partition

Code: 'G','U'
Signature: int get_uf2_target_partition(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, uint32_t family_id,
resident_partition_t *partition_out)
Supported architectures: Arm-S RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function requires additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.
Returns: >= 0 on success (the target partition index), or a negative error code on error.
This method performs the same operation to decide on a taget partition for a UF2 family ID as when a UF2 is dragged
onto the USB drive in BOOTSEL mode.
This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking
signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should byte word-
aligned and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The work area size currently
required is 3064, so 3K is a good choice.
If the partition table hasn’t been loaded (for example, from a watchdog or RAM boot), then this method returns
BOOTROM_ERROR_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET, and you should load the partition table via load_partition_table() first.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 393

##### 5.4.8.19. git_revision

```
Code: 'G','R'
Type: const uint32_t git_revision
The 8 most significant hex digits of the bootrom git revision. Uniquely identifies this version of the bootrom.
```
#####  NOTE

```
This is the git revision built at chip tapeout; the git hash in the public repository is different due to squashed history,
even though the contents are identical. The contents can be verified by building the public bootrom source and
comparing the resulting binary with one binary dumped from the chip.
```
##### 5.4.8.20. load_partition_table

```
Code: 'L','P'
Signature: int load_partition_table(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, bool force_reload)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function requires additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, or a negative error code on error.
Loads the current partition table from flash, if present.
This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking
signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should byte word-
aligned and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The work area size currently
required is 3064, so 3K is a good choice.
If force_reload is false, then this method will return BOOTROM_OK immediately if the bootrom is loaded, otherwise it will
reload the partition table if it has been loaded already, allowing for the partition table to be updated in a running
program.
```
##### 5.4.8.21. otp_access

```
Code: 'O','A'
Signature: int otp_access(uint8_t *buf, uint32_t buf_len, uint32_t row_and_flags)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, or a negative error code on error.
Writes data from a buffer into OTP, or reads data from OTP into a buffer.
```
- 0x0000ffff^ -^ ROW_NUMBER: 16 low bits are row number (0-4095)
- 0x00010000^ -^ IS_WRITE: if set, do a write (not a read)
- 0x00020000^ -^ IS_ECC: if this bit is set, each value in the buffer is 2 bytes and ECC is used when read/writing from 24 bit
    value in OTP. If this bit is not set, each value in the buffer is 4 bytes, the low 24-bits of which are written to or read
    from OTP.
The buffer must be aligned to 2 bytes or 4 bytes according to the IS_ECC flag.
This method will read and write rows until the first row it encounters that fails a key or permission check at which it will
return BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED.
Writing will also stop at the first row where an attempt is made to set an OTP bit from a 1 to a 0, and
BOOTROM_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_MODIFICATION will be returned.
If all rows are read/written successfully, then BOOTROM_OK will be returned.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 394

##### 5.4.8.22. partition_table_ptr

```
Code: 'P','T'
Type: resident_partition_table **partition_table_ptr
A pointer to the pointer to the resident partition table info. The resident partition table is the subset of the full partition
table that is kept in memory, and used for flash permissions.
The public part of the resident partition table info is of the form:
Word Bytes Value
0 1 partition_count (0-16)
1 partition_count_with_permissions (0-16). Set this to > partition_count when adding extra
permission regions at runtime (do not modify the original partitions)
```

Details of the fields permissions_and_location and permissions_and_flags can be found in Section 5.9.4.

##### 5.4.8.23. pick_ab_partition

Code: 'A','B'
Signature: int pick_ab_partition(uint8_t *workarea_base, uint32_t workarea_size, uint partition_a_num)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V. Note on RISC-V this function requires additional stack; see Section 5.4.8.26.
Returns: >= 0 on success (the partition index), or a negative error code on error.
Determines which of the partitions has the "better" IMAGE_DEF. In the case of executable images, this is the one that would
be booted
This method potentially requires similar complexity to the boot path in terms of picking amongst versions, checking
signatures etc. As a result it requires a user provided memory buffer as a work area. The work area should bye word
aligned, and of sufficient size or BOOTROM_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES will be returned. The work area size currently
required is 3064, so 3K is a good choice.
The passed partition number can be any valid partition number other than the "B" partition of an A/B pair.
This method returns a negative error code, or the partition number of the picked partition if (partition_a_num or the
number of its "B" partition if any).
5.4. Bootrom APIs 395

#####  NOTE

This method does not look at owner partitions, only the A partition passed and its corresponding B partition.

##### 5.4.8.24. reboot

```
Code: 'R','B'
Signature: int reboot(uint32_t flags, uint32_t delay_ms, uint32_t p0, uint32_t p1)
Supported architectures: Arm-S, Arm-NS, RISC-V
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (or doesn’t return) on success, a negative error code on error.
Resets the RP2350 and uses the watchdog facility to restart.
The delay_ms is the millisecond delay before the reboot occurs. Note: by default this method is asynchronous (unless
NO_RETURN_ON_SUCCESS is set - see below), so the method will return and the reboot will happen this many milliseconds
later.
The flags field contains one of the following values:
```
- 0x0000^ :^ REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL^ - reboot into the normal boot path.

### ◦ p0^ - the boot diagnostic "partition" (low 8 bits only)

- 0x0002^ :^ REBOOT_TYPE_BOOTSEL^ - reboot into BOOTSEL mode.

### ◦ p0^ - a set of flags:

```
▪ 0x01^ :^ DISABLE_MSD_INTERFACE^ - Disable the BOOTSEL USB drive (see Section 5.5)
▪ 0x02^ :^ DISABLE_PICOBOOT_INTERFACE^ - Disable the PICOBOOT interface (see Section 5.6).
▪ 0x10^ :^ GPIO_PIN_ACTIVE_LOW^ - The GPIO in^ p1^ is active low.
▪ 0x20^ :^ GPIO_PIN_ENABLED^ - Enable the activity indicator on the specified GPIO.
```
### ◦ p1^ - the GPIO number to use as an activity indicator (enabled by flag in^ p0) for the BOOTSEL USB drive.

- 0x0003^ :^ REBOOT_TYPE_RAM_IMAGE^ - reboot into an image in RAM. The region of RAM or XIP RAM is searched for an
    image to run. This is the type of reboot used when a RAM UF2 is dragged onto the BOOTSEL USB drive.

### ◦ p0^ - the region start address (word-aligned).

### ◦ p1^ - the region size (word-aligned).

- 0x0004^ :^ REBOOT_TYPE_FLASH_UPDATE^ - variant of^ REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL^ to use when flash has been updated. This is the type
    of reboot used after dragging a flash UF2 onto the BOOTSEL USB drive.

### ◦ p0^ - the address of the start of the region of flash that was updated. If this address matches the start address

```
of a partition or slot, then that partition or slot is treated preferentially during boot (when there is a choice).
This type of boot facilitates TBYB (Section 5.1.17) and version downgrades.
```
- 0x000d^ :^ REBOOT_TYPE_PC_SP^ - reboot to a specific PC and SP. Note: this is not allowed in the^ Arm-NS^ variant.

### ◦ p0^ - the initial program counter (PC) to start executing at. This must have the lowest bit set for Arm and clear

for RISC-V

### ◦ p1^ - the initial stack pointer (SP).

All of the above, can have optional flags ORed in:

- 0x0010^ :^ REBOOT_TO_ARM^ - switch both cores to the Arm architecture (rather than leaving them as is). The call will fail
    with BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE if the Arm architecture is not supported.
- 0x0020^ :^ REBOOT_TO_RISCV^ - switch both cores to the RISC-V architecture (rather than leaving them as is). The call will
    fail with BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE if the RISC-V architecture is not supported.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 396

- 0x0100^ :^ NO_RETURN_ON_SUCCESS^ - the watchdog hardware is asynchronous. Setting this bit forces this method not to
    return if the reboot is successfully initiated.

#####  NOTE

```
The p0 and p1 parameters are generally written to watchdog scratch registers 2 & 3, and are interpreted post-reboot
by the boot path code. The exception is REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL where this API handles the p0 value before rebooting; the
boot path itself does not accept any parameters for REBOOT_TYPE_NORMAL.
```
##### 5.4.8.25. secure_call

```
Code: 'S','C'
Signature: int secure_call(...)
Supported architectures: Arm-NS
Returns: >= 0 on success, a negative error code on error.
Call a Secure method from Non-secure code, passing the method to be called in the register r4 (other arguments
passed as normal).
This method provides the ability to decouple the Non-secure code from the Secure code, allowing the former to call
methods in the latter without needing to know the location of the methods.
This call will always return BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_STATE unless Secure Arm code has provided a handler function via
set_rom_callback(); if there is a handler function, this method will return the return code that the handler returns, with
the convention that BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ARG if the "function selector" (in r4) is not supported.
Certain well-known "function selectors" will be pre-defined to facilitate interaction between Secure and Non-secure SDK
code, or indeed with other environments (for example, logging to secure UART/USB CDC, launch of core 1 from NS
code, watchdog reboot from NS code back into NS code, etc.)
To avoid conflicts the following bit patterns are used for "function selectors":
```
- 0b0xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx^ is a "well known" function selector; don’t use for your own methods
- 0b10xx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx^ is a "unique" function selector intended to be unlikely to clash with
    others'. The lower 30 bits should be chosen at random
- 0b11xx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx^ is a "private" function selector intended for use by tightly coupled NS and
    S code

##### 5.4.8.26. set_bootrom_stack

Code: 'S','S'
Signature: int set_bootrom_stack(uint32_t base_size[2])
Supported architectures: RISC-V
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, a negative error code on error.
Most bootrom functions are written just once, in Arm code, to save space. As a result these functions are emulated
when running under the RISC-V architecture. This is largely transparent to the user, however the stack used by the Arm
emulation is separate from the calling user’s stack, and is stored in boot RAM and is of quite limited size. When using
certain of the more complex APIs or if nesting bootrom calls from within IRQs, you may need to provide a larger stack.
This method allows the caller to specify a region of RAM to use as the stack for the current core by passing a pointer to
two values: the word aligned base address, and the size in bytes (multiple of 4).
The method fills in the previous base/size values into the passed array before returning.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 397

##### 5.4.8.27. set_ns_api_permission

```
Code: 'S','P'
Signature: int set_ns_api_permission(uint ns_api_num, bool allowed)
Supported architectures: Arm-S
Returns: BOOTROM_OK (0) on success, a negative error code on error.
Allow or disallow the specific NS API; all NS APIs default to disabled.
ns_api_num is one of the following, configuring Arm-NS access to the given API. When an NS API is disabled, calling it will
return BOOTROM_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED.
```
- 0x0:^ get_sys_info
- 0x1:^ flash_op
- 0x2:^ flash_runtime_to_storage_addr
- 0x3:^ get_partition_table_info
- 0x4:^ secure_call
- 0x5:^ otp_access
- 0x6:^ reboot
- 0x7:^ get_b_partition

 (^) NOTE
All permissions default to disallowed after a reset (see also bootrom_state_reset()).

##### 5.4.8.28. set_rom_callback

```
Code: 'R','C'
Signature: int set_rom_callback(uint callback_number, int (*callback)(...))
Supported architectures: Arm-S, RISC-V
Returns: >= 0 (the old callback pointer) on success, a negative error code on error.
The only currently supported callback_number is 0 which sets the callback used for the secure_call API.
A callback pointer of 0 deletes the callback function, a positive callback pointer (all valid function pointers are on
RP2350) sets the callback function, but a negative callback pointer can be passed to get the old value without setting a
new value.
If successful, returns >=0 (the existing value of the function pointer on entry to the function).
```
##### 5.4.8.29. validate_ns_buffer

Code: 'V','B'
Signature: void *validate_ns_buffer(const void *addr, uint32_t size, uint32_t write, uint32_t *ok)
Supported architectures: Arm-S
Returns: addr on success, or a negative error code on error. On RP2350 A3 and newer there are additional out-of-band
return values, detailed below.
Utility method that can be used by Secure Arm code to validate a buffer passed to it from Non-secure code.
5.4. Bootrom APIs 398

```
Both the write parameter and the (out) result parameter ok are RCP booleans, so 0xa500a500 for true, and 0x00c300c3 for
false. This enables hardening of this function, and indeed the write parameter must be one of these values or the RCP
will halt the system.
For success, the entire buffer must fit in range XIP_BASE → SRAM_END, and must be accessible by the Non-secure caller
according to SAU + NS MPU (privileged or not based on current processor IPSR and NS CONTROL flag). Buffers in USB
RAM are also allowed if access is granted to NS via ACCESSCTRL.
On RP2350 A3 and newer, additional out-of-band information is returned from this function to aid calling from assembly
code:
```
- The RCP boolean value returned in the location pointed to by^ ok^ is now also returned in processor register^ r1^ (a
    valid ok pointer value or 0 must still be passed).
- The passed size is returned in register^ r3.
- The^ N^ flag is set based on the register^ r1^ value, so you can immediately branch with^ bpl^ for failure.
The A3 bootrom uses a call pattern similar to that shown below to help harden the code against hardware attacks,
which might cause skipping of instructions:
// at this point, r0, r2, r3 already hold arguments for buffer, write, and *ok
1: movs r1, #0 // set r1 to invalid RCP_VALUE zero and set N=0
2: mov r1, ra // set r1 to size value (stored in another register a)
3: bl validate_ns_buffer // call the validate function
4: bpl buffer_invalid // N==0 is deemed to be false (invalid)
5: rcp_btrue r1 // negative value shoule be 0xa500a500
buffer_valid:
6: movs rb, ra // reload size for use
7: rcp_iequal r3, rb // check r3 has the correct size
// r0 holds 'buffer' on success; this can be used as a check too if desired
8: // do some secure code with `buffer` and `size`
...
buffer_invalid:
// r0 holds BOOTROM_ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS
...

##### 5.4.8.30. xip_setup_func_ptr

```
Code: 'X','F'
Type: void *(xip_setup_func_ptr)(void)'
```
## 5.5. USB mass storage interface

```
The bootrom provides a standard USB bootloader that makes a writeable drive available for copying code to the RP2350
using UF2 files (see Section 5.5.2).
A suitable UF2 file copied to the drive is downloaded and written to flash or RAM, and the device is automatically
rebooted, making it trivial to download and run code on the RP2350 using only a USB connection.
```
#### 5.5.1. The RP2350 drive

RP2350 appears as a standard 128MB flash drive named RP2350 formatted as a single partition with FAT16. There are
only ever two actual files visible on the drive specified.
5.5. USB mass storage interface 399

- INFO_UF2.TXT^ contains a string description of the UF2 bootloader and version.
- INDEX.HTM^ redirects to information about the RP2350 device.
The default INDEX.HTM for RP2350 A2 is https://raspberrypi.com/device/RP2?version=5A09D5312E22. The version
parameter is changed for other RP2350 revisions; the first 6 characters are from the git hash of the chip, and the next 6
characters are from the git hash of the bootrom. The contents of these files and the name of the drive may be
customised. For more information, see Section 5.7.
Any type of files may be written to the USB drive from the host; however, in general these aren’t stored, and only appear
to be so because of caching on the host side.
When a suitable UF2 file is written to the device, the special contents are recognised and data is written to specified
locations in RAM or flash.
Where flash-targeted UF2s are written on RP2350 is determined by the family id of the UF2 contents and the partition
table.
If there’s no partition table, then UF2s are stored at the address they specify; otherwise they (with the exception of the
special ABSOLUTE family id) are stored into a single partition, with UF2 flash address 0x10000000 mapping to the start of
the partition.
It’s possible, based on the partition table or family id, that the UF2 isn’t downloadable anywhere in flash, in which case,
it’s ignored. Further detail can be discovered via GET_INFO - UF2_STATUS. On the completed download of an entire
valid UF2 file, RP2350 automatically reboots to run the newly downloaded code.
Invalid UF2 files might not write at all or only write partially to RP2350 before failing. Not all operating systems notify
you of disk write errors after a failed write. You can use picotool verify to verify that a UF2 file wrote correctly to
RP2350.

#### 5.5.2. UF2 format details

This section describes the constraints on a UF2 file to be valid for download.

 (^) TIP
To generate UF2 files, you can use the picootol uf2 convert functionality in picotool.
All data destined for the device must be in UF2 blocks with:

- A^ familyID^ present, with a value in the reserved range^ 0xe48bff58^ through^ 0xe48bff5b^ or a user family ID configured in
    a partition table (see table in Section 5.5.3).
- A^ payload_size^ of^256.
All data must be destined for (and fit entirely within) the following memory ranges (depending on the type of binary
being downloaded which is determined by the address of the first UF2 block encountered):
- A regular flash image

### ◦ 0x10000000-0x12000000^ flash:^ All blocks must be targeted at 256 byte alignments. Writes beyond the end of

physical flash will wrap back to the beginning of flash.

- A^ RAM only^ image

### ◦ 0x20000000-0x20082000^ main RAM:^ Blocks can be positioned with byte alignment.

### ◦ 0x13ffc000-0x14000000^ XIP RAM:^ (since flash isn’t being targeted, the flash cache is available for use as RAM

with same properties as main RAM).
5.5. USB mass storage interface 400

#####  NOTE

```
Traditionally UF2 has only been used to write to flash, but this is more a limitation of using the metadata-free
.BIN file as the source to generate the UF2 file. RP2350 takes full advantage of the inherent flexibility of UF2 to
support the full range of binaries in the richer .ELF format produced by the build to be used as the source for the
UF2 file.
```
- The^ numBlocks^ must specify a total size of the binary that fits in the regions specified above
- A change of^ numBlocks^ or the binary type (determined by^ UF2^ block target address) will discard the current transfer
    in progress.
- A change in the^ familyID^ will discard the current transfer in progress.
- All device destined data must be in blocks without the^ UF2_FLAG_NOT_MAIN_FLASH^ marking which relates to content to
    be ignored rather than flash vs RAM.

#####  NOTE

```
When targeting flash, the UF2 block target addresses are interpreted to be in the content of a flash binary that starts
at 0x10000000. The UF2 image may be downloaded into a partition that starts somewhere else in flash, so the actual
storage address is uf2_image_target_base + uf2_block_target_addr - 0x10000000.
The flash is always erased a 4 kB sector at a time, so including data for only a subset of the 256-byte pages within a
sector in a flash-binary UF2 will leave the remaining 256-byte pages of the sector erased but undefined.
A binary is considered "downloaded" when each of the numBlocks blocks has been seen at least once in the course of a
single valid transfer. The data for a block is only written the first time in case of the host resending duplicate blocks.
After a UF2 is completely downloaded, the RP2350 reboots, ostensibly to run the new binary. Since RP2350 supports
downloading a variety of executable and non-executable UF2s into partitions, the partition contains a flag which can be
used to turn off this reboot behaviour on a case by case basis.
```
#####  NOTE

```
When rebooting after a flash download, a flash update boot is performed. As a result, the newly written partition is
preferred when considered in an A/B choice, but it doesn’t boot if another bootable image is found in an earlier
partition. When rebooting after a RAM download, then the image search starts at the lowest address of a
downloaded block (with main RAM considered lower than flash cache if both are present, and the search only
spanning one of either main RAM or the flash cache)
It is possible for host software to temporarily disable UF2 writes via the PICOBOOT interface to prevent interference
with operations being performed via that interface (see below), in which case any UF2 file write in progress will be
aborted.
```
#####  NOTE

```
If a problem is encountered downloading the UF2, then it will appear as if nothing has happened since the device will
not reboot. The picotool command uf2 info can be used to determine the status of the last download in this case
(see also GET_INFO - UF2_STATUS).
```
#### 5.5.3. UF2 targeting rules

When the first block of a UF2 is downloaded, a choice is made where to store the UF2 in flash based on the family ID of
the UF2. This choice is performed by the same code as the get_uf2_target_partition() API (see Section 5.4.8.18).
The following family IDs are defined by the bootrom. However, the user can use their own for more specific targeting:
5.5. USB mass storage interface 401

Table 455. Table of
standard UF2 family
IDs understood by the
RP2350 bootrom
Name Value Description
absolute 0xe48bff57 Special family ID for content intended to be written directly to flash, ignoring
partitions.
rp2040 0xe48bff56 RP2040 executable image.
data 0xe48bff58 Generic catch-all for data UF2s.
rp2350_arm_s 0xe48bff59 RP2350 Arm Secure image (one intended to be booted by the bootrom).

rp2350_arm_ns 0xe48bff5b RP2350 Arm Non-secure image. Not directly bootable by the bootrom.
However, Secure user code is likely to want to be able to locate binaries of this
type.

#####  NOTE

```
The only information available to the algorithm that makes the choice of where to store the UF2, is the UF2 family ID;
the algorithm can’t look inside at the UF2 contents as UF2 data sectors may appear at the device in any order.
A UF2 with the absolute family ID is downloaded without regard to partition boundaries. A partition table (if present) or
OTP configuration can define whether absolute family ID downloads are allowed, and download to the start of flash. The
default factory settings allow for absolute family ID downloads
If there is a partition table present, any other family IDs download to a single partition; if there is no partition table
present then the data, rp2350-arm-s (if Arm architecture is enabled) and rp2350-riscv (if RISC-V architecture is enabled)
family IDs are allowed by default, and the UF2 is always downloaded to the start of flash.
If a partition table is present, then up to four passes are made over the partition table (from first to last partition
encountered) until a matching partition is found; Each pass has different selection criteria:
```
1. Look for an (unowned) A partition, ignoring those marked NOT_BOOTABLE for the current CPU architecture
    Use of the NOT_BOOTABLE_ flags allows you to have separate boot partitions for each CPU architecture (Arm or RISC-
    V); were you not to use NOT_BOOTABLE_ flags in this scenario, and say the first encountered partition has an Arm
    IMAGE_DEF, then, when booting under the RISC-V architecture with auto architecture switching enabled, the bootrom
    would just switch back into the Arm architecture to boot the Arm binary. Marking the first partition as
    NOT_BOOTABLE_RISCV in the partition table solves this problem.
    The correct CPU architecture refers to a match between the architecture of the UF2 (determined by family ID of
    rp2350_arm_s or rp2350_riscv) and the current CPU architecture.
    This pass allows the user to drop either Arm or RISC-V UF2s, and have them stored as you’d want for the
    NOT_BOOTABLE_ flag scenario.
2. If auto architecture switching is enabled and the other architecture is available, look for an (unowned) A partition,
    ignoring those marked NOT_BOOTABLE for that CPU architecture.
    This pass is designed to match the boot use case of booting images from the other architecture as a fallback. If
    there is a partition that would be booted as a result auto architecture switching then this a reasonable place to
    store this UF2 for the alternative architecture.
3. Look for any unowned A partition that accepts the family ID
    This pass provides a way to target any UF2s to a partitions based on family ID, but assumes that you’d prefer a
    UF2 to go into a matching top-level partition vs an owned partition.
4. Finally, look for any A partition that accepts the family ID
    This pass implicitly only looks at owned partitions, since unowned partitions would have been matched in the
    previous pass.
If none of the passes find a match, the UF2 contents aren’t then downloaded. The picotool command uf2 info can be
5.5. USB mass storage interface 402

used to determine the status of the last download in this case (see also GET_INFO - UF2_STATUS).

##### 5.5.3.1. A/B partitions and ownership

```
Each of the above passes refers to finding an A partition. Any partition that isn’t a B partition is an A partition; an unpaired
partition is classed as an A partition.
If the found A partition doesn’t have a B partition paired with it, then the A partition is the UF2 target partition.
If however, the A partition has a B partition, then a further choice must be made as to which of the A/B partitions should
be targeted.
```
1. If the A partition is unowned, then the partition choice is made based on any current valid IMAGE_DEF in those
    partitions. The valid partition with the higher version number isn’t chosen; in the case of executable IMAGE_DEFs, this
    is the opposite of what would happen during boot; this makes sense as you want to drop the UF2 on the partition
    which isn’t currently booting.
2. If the A partition is marked owned, then the contents of the A partition and B partition are assumed not to contain
    IMAGE_DEFs which can be used to make a version based choice. Therefore, the owner of the A partition (Aowner) and its
    B partition (Bowner) are used to make the choice
    It is however dependent on the use case whether you would want a UF2 that is destined for partition A / partition B
    to go into partition A when partition Aowner has an IMAGE_DEF with the higher version (would boot if the IMAGE_DEF was
    executable) or when Bowner has an IMAGE_DEF with the higher version. By default, the bootrom picks partition A when
    partition Aowner has the higher versioned IMAGE_DEF, however this can be changed by setting the
    UF2_DOWNLOAD_AB_NON_BOOTABLE_OWNER_AFFINITY flag in partition A.

##### 5.5.3.2. Multiple UF2 families

```
It is possible to include sectors targeting different family IDs in the same UF2 file. The intention in the UF2 specification
is to allow one file to be shipped for multiple different devices, but the expectation is that each device only accepts one
UF2 family ID.
Similarly on RP2350, it is only supported to download a UF2 file containing multiple family IDs if only one of those family
IDs is acceptable for download to the device according to the above rules.
```
## 5.6. USB PICOBOOT interface

```
The PICOBOOT interface is a low level USB protocol for interacting with the RP2350 while it is in BOOTSEL mode. This
interface may be used concurrently with the USB Mass Storage Interface.
It provides for flexible reading from and writing to RAM or flash, rebooting, executing code on the device and a handful
of other management functions.
Constants and structures related to the interface can be found in the SDK header picoboot.h in the SDK
```
#### 5.6.1. Identifying the device

A RP2350 device can recognised by the Vendor ID and Product ID in its device descriptor (shown in Table 456), unless
different values have been set in OTP (see Section 5.7)
Table 456. RP2350

#### 5.6.2. Identifying the interface

The PICOBOOT interface is recognised by the vendor-specific Interface Class, the zero Interface Sub Class, and
Interface Protocol (shown in Table 457).
Don’t rely on the interface number, because that is dependent on whether the device is currently exposing the Mass
Storage Interface. The device might not be currently exposing the PICOBOOT interface at all, so you mustn’t assume it’s
present.

bNumEndpoints 2
bInterfaceClass 0xff (vendor specific)

bInterfaceSubClass (^0)

#### 5.6.3. Identifying the endpoints

The PICOBOOT interface provides a single BULK_OUT and a single BULK_IN endpoint. These can be identified by their
direction and type. You mustn’t rely on endpoint numbers.
5.6. USB PICOBOOT interface 404

#### 5.6.4. PICOBOOT Commands

The two bulk endpoints are used for sending commands and retrieved successful command results. All commands are
exactly 32 bytes (see Table 458) and sent to the BULK_OUT endpoint.
Table 458. PICOBOOT
Command Definition Offset^ Name^ Description
0x00 dMagic The value 0x431fd10b
0x04 dToken A user provided token to identify this request by
0x08 bCmdId The ID of the command. Note that the top bit indicates data transfer direction
(0x80 = IN)
0x09 bCmdSize Number of bytes of valid data in the args field
0x0a reserved 0x0000
0x0c dTransferLength The number of bytes the host expects to send or receive over the bulk channel
0x10 args 16 bytes of command-specific data padded with zeros
If a command sent is invalid or not recognised, the bulk endpoints will be stalled. Further information will be available
via the GET_COMMAND_STATUS request (see Section 5.6.5.2).
Following the initial 32 byte packet, if dTransferLength is non-zero, then that many bytes are transferred over the bulk pipe
and the command is completed with an empty packet in the opposite direction. If dTransferLength is zero then command
success is indicated by an empty IN packet.
The following commands are supported (note common fields dMagic, dToken, and reserved are omitted for clarity)

##### 5.6.4.1. EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS (0x01)

Claim or release exclusive access for writing to the RP2350 over USB (versus the Mass Storage Interface)

EXCLUSIVE (1) Disable USB Mass Storage writes (the host should
see them as write protect failures, but in any case
any active UF2 download will be aborted)
EXCLUSIVE_AND_EJECT (2) Lock the USB Mass Storage Interface out by
marking the drive media as not present (ejecting
the drive)

multiple of pages (256 bytes) then the last page is zero-filled to the end.

##### 5.6.4.6. EXIT_XIP (0x06)

A no-op provided for compatibility with RP2040. An XIP exit sequence (flash_exit_xip()) is issued once before entering
the USB bootloader, which returns the external QSPI device from whatever XIP state it was in to a serial command state,
and the external QSPI device then remains in this state until reboot.

## 5.7. USB white-labelling

To brand RP2350-based products, customers may replace identifying information exposed by USB interfaces. We call
this white-labelling, and you can accomplish it in RP2350 by specifying values in OTP.
5.7. USB white-labelling 412

1. Write the OTP location of the white-label data structure via USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR (see that register description
    for the data structure contents).
2. Initialise the fields you wish to override in the white-label data structure and mark them valid.
3. Set USB_BOOT_FLAGS.WHITE_LABEL_ADDR_VALID to mark the white-labelling as valid.
The following fields can be modified:

#### 5.7.1. USB device descriptor

The USB device descriptor includes the following 16-bit values:

- VID^ (default^ 0x2e8a)
- PID^ (default^ 0x000f)
- BCD_DEVICE^ (default^ 0x0100)
- LANG_ID^ (default^ 0x0409)

#### 5.7.2. USB device strings

- MANUFACTURER^ (default "Raspberry Pi", max-length 30 UTF-16 or ASCII chars)
- PRODUCT^ (default "RP2350 Boot", max-length 30 UTF-16 or ASCII chars)
- SERIAL_NUMBER^ (default uppercase hex string of the^ device_id; first 4 rows of OTP, max-length 30 UTF-16 or ASCII
    chars)

#### 5.7.3. USB configuration descriptor

The USB Configuration Description isn’t strictly white-labelling, but is still helpful for users:

- ATTRIBUTES_MAX_POWER_VALUES^ (default^ 0xfa80, meaning^ bMaxPower^ of^ 0xfa^ and^ bmAttributes=0x80)

#### 5.7.4. MSD drive

- VOLUME_LABEL^ (default "RP2350", max-length 11 ASCII chars)

#### 5.7.5. UF2 INDEX.HTM file

```
- REDIRECT_URL^ (default "https://raspberrypi.com/device/RP2?version=5A09D5312E22", note the 12 hex digits are the
    first 6 of the SYSINFO_GITREF_RP2350 and the first 6 of the bootrom gitref, max-length 127 ASCII chars)
- REDIRECT_NAME^ (default "raspberrypi.com", max-length 127 ASCII chars)

```
- MODEL^ (default "Raspberry Pi RP2350", max-length 127 ASCII chars)

- VENDOR^ (default "RPI", max-length 8 ASCII chars)
- PRODUCT^ (default "RP2350", max-length 16 ASCII chars)
- VERSION^ (default "1", max-length 4 ASCII chars)

#### 5.7.8. Volume label simple example

Newer versions of picotool can load white-label data from a JSON file using the picotool otp white-label -s <start row>
<JSON filename> command. An example JSON file to set the volume label to "SPOON" would be:
{
"volume": {
"label": "SPOON"
}
}
The <start row> is the OTP row where the white-label structure will be written - for example 0x400.
The full set of white-label fields which can be written using a JSON file are shown below. The manufacturer, product and
serial_number fields support Unicode characters, if you need special characters or emoji in your product name, but this
will take up twice as much room per character in the OTP for that field.
{
"device": {
"vid": "0x2e8b",
"pid": "0x000e",
"bcd": 2.15,
"lang_id": "0x0c09",
"manufacturer": "Test's Pis",
"product": "Test RP2350?",
"serial_number": "notnecessarilyanumber",
"max_power": "0x20",
"attributes": "0xe0"
},
"scsi": {
"vendor": "TestPi",
"product": "MyPi",

"redirect_name": "The datasheet",
"model": "My Test Pi",
"board_id": "TPI-RP2350"
}
}
```
#### 5.7.9. Volume label in-depth example

The following example demonstrates how to manually change the volume label using picotool to the value "SPOON":

1. First, define the row of white label structure to be 0x400:
    $ picotool otp set -e OTP_DATA_USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR 0x400
2. Next, because the volume label is located at index 0x8 within OTP_DATA_USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR, write to 0x408. Define the
    location of the volume label string to be offset from OTP_DATA_USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR by 0x30. For this example,
    "SPOON" has 5 characters, so we write 0x3005 to 0x408:
       $ picotool otp set -e 0x408 0x3005
3. Then, write the "S" and "P" characters:
    $ picotool otp set -e 0x430 0x5053
4. Then, write the "O" and "O" characters:
    $ picotool otp set -e 0x431 0x4f4f
5. Then, write the "N" character:
    $ picotool otp set -e 0x432 0x4e
6. Finally, enable the valid override to use the new values (bit 8 marks the VOLUME_LABEL override as valid, and bit 22
    marks the OTP_DATA_USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR override as valid):
       $ picotool otp set -r OTP_DATA_USB_BOOT_FLAGS 0x400100
7. To put your changes into effect, reboot the device:
    $ picotool reboot -u

UART boot is a minimal interface for bootstrapping a flashless RP2350 from a simple host, such as another
microcontroller. It is available by default on a blank device, so it allows RP2350 to be deployed into the field on multi-
device boards without loading firmware or programming OTP bits in advance.
To select UART boot, drive QSPI CSn low (BOOTSEL mode) and drive QSPI SD1 high. The bootrom checks these signals
shortly after device reset is released. UART TX appears on QSPI SD2, and UART RX appears on QSPI SD3.
The UART mode is 8n1: one start bit, eight data bits, no parity, one stop bit. Data within each UART frame is sent and
received LSB-first. The baud rate is fixed at 1 Mbaud.
```
#### 5.8.1. Baud rate and clock requirements

```
The nominal baud rate for UART boot is 1 Mbaud, divided from a nominal 48 MHz system clock frequency. UART boot
uses the USB PLL to derive the system clock and UART baud clock, so you must either provide a crystal or drive a stable
clock into the crystal oscillator XIN pad. The host baud rate must match the RP2350 baud rate within 3%.
By default the crystal is assumed to be 12 MHz, but the BOOTSEL_PLL_CFG and BOOTSEL_XOSC_CFG OTP locations
override this to achieve a nominal 48 MHz system clock from any supported crystal. The same OTP configuration is
used for both USB and UART boot.
```
 (^) TIP
You may drive a somewhat faster or slower clock into XIN without any OTP configuration, if you scale your UART
baud rate appropriately. The permissible range is 7.5 to 16 MHz on XIN, limited by the PLL VCO frequency range.

#### 5.8.2. UART boot shell protocol

After the bootrom samples QSPI CSn and SD1, there will be a delay of several milliseconds as the bootrom goes through
some necessary steps such as switching from the ring oscillator to the PLL, and erasing SRAM before releasing it to the
Non-secure UART bootloader.
The UART bootloader signals it is ready to begin by printing the ASCII splash string RP2350. In bytes, this is 0x52, 0x50, 0x32,
0x33, 0x35, 0x30.
Before sending any commands, you must send a special knock sequence to unlock the interface. This is a measure to
avoid transient effects due to noise on GPIOs and ensure the host and device are initially well-synchronised. The
sequence is: 0x56, 0xff, 0x8b, 0xe4. This is the RP2040 UF2 family ID, chosen as a well-known magic number. Any
sequence of bytes ending with this four-byte sequence is detected.
A UART boot shell command is always in the host-to-device direction (RP2350 receives), and consists of a single
command byte, optionally followed by a 32-byte write payload. RP2350 responds with an optional 32-byte read payload
followed by an echo of the command byte. You should wait for the command echo before sending the next command.
The supported commands are:
Command
(ASCII)
Command
(hex)
Description
n 0x6e No-op. Do nothing, and report back when you’ve done it. Used to ping the interface when
recovering lost synchronisation. Echoes the command byte, 'n'.
w 0x77 Write a 32-byte payload to the current value of the read/write pointer. Increment the address
pointer by 32. Echoes the command byte, 'w', once all 32 bytes are written to memory.
r 0x72 Read a 32-byte payload from the current value of the read/write pointer. Increment the
address pointer by 32. Echoes the command byte, 'r', after transmitting the 32-byte read
payload.
5.8. UART boot 416

```
Command
(ASCII)
Command
(hex)
Description
```
c 0x63 (^) Clear the read/write pointer. The pointer resets to the first location in SRAM 0x20000000, and
you can begin a new read or write sequence from there. Echoes the command byte, 'c'.
x 0x78 Execute the payload that has been written to memory. Echoes the command byte, 'x', and
then reboots, passing a RAM boot search window spanning all of main SRAM. If a valid binary
was successfully written into SRAM before sending this command, it will execute.
Unrecognised commands are echoed with no other effect. More commands may be added in future versions.

#### 5.8.3. UART boot programming flow

1. Reset or power down the RP2350 device.
2. Drive CSn low to select BOOTSEL, and SD1 high to select UART.
3. Release the reset or power up the device.
4. Wait for the splash string to be transmitted on QSPI SD2 (TX).
5. Transmit the knock sequence 0x56, 0xff, 0x8b, 0xe4 on QSPI SD3 (RX)
6. Send a 'n' nop command to ensure the interface is awake; if there is no reply, send the knock sequence again.
7. Send 'w' commands until your entire write payload transfers.
8. (Optional) Send a 'c' clear command to reset the address pointer, and then send 'r' read commands to read back
    and verify the payload.
9. Send an 'x' execute command to attempt to run the payload.
There is no feedback from UART boot after echoing the final 'x' command. At this point the device reboots to attempt a
RAM image boot on the data loaded by the Non-secure UART bootloader. If the RAM image boot fails, the bootrom falls
through to the next boot source, continuing the normal boot flow. Maintaining CSn driven low and SD1 driven high will
cause the bootrom to fall through back to UART boot a second time, re-sending the UART splash screen: this indicates
the bootrom failed to recognise the UART boot binary.

#### 5.8.4. Recovering from a stuck interface

```
Noise on the GPIOs may cause the UART boot shell to stop replying to commands, for example because it thinks the
host is part way through a write payload, and the host thinks that it is not. To resynchronise to the start of the next
command:
```
1. Wait 1 ms for the link to quiesce
2. Send 33 'n' NOP commands (size of longest command)
3. Wait 1 ms and flush your receive data
4. Send 1 'n' NOP command and confirm the device responds with an echoed NOP
If the interface fails to recover, reboot the device and try again. Failure may be caused by:
- Noise on GPIOs (particularly over long traces or wires)
- Incorrect baud rate matching
- An unstable frequency reference on XOSC^ XIN
- Mismatch of voltage levels (for example a QSPI_IOVDD of 1.8 V on RP2350, and a 3.3 V IO voltage on the host)
5.8. UART boot 417

#### 5.8.5. Requirements for UART boot binaries

```
A UART boot binary is a normal RAM binary. It must have a valid IMAGE_DEF in order for the boot path to recognise it as a
bootable binary. The search window for the IMAGE_DEF is the whole of SRAM, but it’s recommended to place it close to
the beginning, because the bootrom searches linearly forward for the beginning of the IMAGE_DEF.
The maximum size for a UART boot binary is the entirety of main SRAM: 520 kB, or 532 480 bytes.
UART boot only supports loading to the start of SRAM, so your binary must be linked to run at address 0x20000000.
Sparse loading is unsupported. Your program must load as a single flat binary image.
All security requirements relating to RAM image boot apply to UART boot too. If secure boot is enabled, your binary
must be signed. Likewise, if OTP anti-rollback versioning is in effect, your binary’s rollback version must be no lower
than the version number stored in OTP.
```
## 5.9. Metadata block details

#### 5.9.1. Blocks and block loops

```
Blocks consist of a fixed 32-bit header, one or more items, a 32-bit relative offset to the next block, and a fixed 32-bit
footer. All multi-byte values within a block are little-endian. Blocks must start on a word-aligned boundary, and the total
size is always an exact number of words (a multiple of four bytes).
The final item in a block must be of type PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_LAST, which encodes the total word count of the block’s
items.
The 32-bit relative link forms a linked list of blocks. To be valid, this linked list must eventually link back to the first block
in the list, forming a closed block loop; failure to close the loop results in the entire linked list being ignored. The loop
rule is used to avoid treating orphaned blocks from partially overwritten images being treated as valid.
Due to RAM restrictions in the boot path, size of blocks is limited to 640 bytes for PARTITION_TABLEs and 384 bytes for
IMAGE_DEFs. Blocks larger than this are ignored.
The format of a simple block with two items is shown:
Item Word Bytes Value
HEADER 0 4 0xffffded3
ITEM 0 1 1 size_flag:1 (0 means 1-byte size, 1 means 2-byte size), item_type:7
1 s0 % 256
1 s0 / 256 if size_flag == 1 or type-specific data for blocks that are never > 256
words
1 Type-specific data
```
... (^) ... ...
ITEM 1 1 + s0 1 size_flag:1 (0 means 1-byte size, 1 means 2-byte size), item_type:7
1 s1 % 256
1 s1 / 256 if size_flag == 1 or type-specific data for blocks that are never > 256
words
1 Type-specific data
... (^) ... ...
5.9. Metadata block details 418

```
Item Word Bytes Value
LAST_ITEM 1 + s0 + s1 1 0xff (size_flag == 1, item type == BLOCK_ITEM_LAST)
2 s1 + s2 (other items' size)
1 0x00 (pad)
LINK 2 + s0 + s1 4 Relative position in bytes of next block HEADER relative to this block’s HEADER. this
forms a loop, so a single block loop has 0 here.
FOOTER 3 + s0 + s1 4 0xab123579
IMAGE_DEF and PARTITION_TABLE blocks are recognised by their first item being an IMAGE_DEF or PARTITION_TABLE item.
Constants describing blocks can be found in the SDK in picobin.h in the SDK.
```
#### 5.9.2. Common block items

The following items might appear in a IMAGE_DEF or a PARTITION_TABLE block.

##### 5.9.2.1. VERSION item

```
A major/minor version number for the binary, 32 bits total, plus optionally a 16-bit rollback version and a list of OTP
rows which can be read to determine the (thermometer-coded) minimum major rollback version which this device will
allow to be installed. The major and minor are always present, whereas the rollback version and OTP row list are
generally only included if rollback protection is required.
```
 (^) NOTE
The rollback version and OTP row list are only valid for IMAGE_DEFs, and are ignored on a RP2350 that hasn’t been
secured.
If the number of OTP row entries is zero, there is no rollback version for this block.
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x48 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_VERSION)
1 2 + ((num_otp_row_entries != 0) + num_row_entries + 1) / 2
1 0x00 (pad)
1 num_otp_row_entries
1 2 Minor Version
2 Major Version
(2) (2) Rollback version (if num_otp_entries != 0)
(2) First 16-bit OTP Row index (if num_otp_entries != 0`)
... ... Remaining 16-OTP Row indexes (padded with a zero to make a word boundary if necessary)
Each OTP row entry indicates the row number (1 through 4095 inclusive) of the first in a group of 3 OTP rows. The three
OTP rows are each read as a 24 bit raw value, combined via a bitwise majority vote, and then the index of the most-
significant 1 bit determines the version number. So, a single group of three rows can encode rollback versions from 0 to
23 inclusive, or, when all 24 bits are set, an indeterminate version of at least 24. Each additional OTP row index indicates
a further group of 3 rows that increases the maximum version by 24.
There is no requirement for different OTP row entries to be contiguous in OTP. They should not overlap, though the
5.9. Metadata block details 419

bootrom doesn’t need to check this (the boot signing tool may).

 (^) NOTE
For this entry to be considered valid, the number of available bits in the indicated OTP rows must be strictly greater
than the rollback version. This means that it is always possible to determine that the device’s minimum rollback
version is greater than the rollback version indicated in this block, even if we don’t know the full list of OTP rows
used by later major versions.
The major/minor version are used to disambiguate which is newer out of two binaries with the same major rollback
version. For example, to select which A/B image to boot from. when no major rollback version is specified, A/B
comparisons will treat the missing major version as zero, but no rollback check will be performed.

##### 5.9.2.2. HASH_DEF item

```
Optional item with information about what how to hash:
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x47 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_HASH_DEF)
1 0x03 (size_lo)
1 0x00 (pad)
1 0x01 (PICOBIN_HASH_SHA-256)
1 2 Number of words of block hashed (not including HEADER word at the start of the block)
2 0x0000 (pad)
block_words_hashed must include this item if using this item for a signature.
The most recent LOAD_MAP item (see Section 5.9.3.2) that defines what to hash.
```
##### 5.9.2.3. HASH_VALUE item

Optional item containing a hash value that can be used by the bootrom to verify the hash of an image or partition table
when not using signatures.
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x09 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_HASH_VALUE)
1 0x01 + n where n is the number of hash words included (1-8)
2 0x0000 (pad)
1 4 Hash Value (lowest significant 32 bits)
... ... ...
n 4 Hash Value (highest significant 32 bits)
5.9. Metadata block details 420

#####  TIP

```
Whilst a SHA-256 hash is 8 words, you can include fewer (down to 1 word) to save space if you like, and only that
many words will be compared against the full 8-word hash at runtime.
This HASH_VALUE item is paired with the most recent HASH_DEF item (Section 5.9.2.2) which defines what is being hashed.
```
##### 5.9.2.4. SIGNATURE item

```
Optional item containing cryptographic signature that can be used by the bootrom to signature check the hashed
contents of an image or partition table.
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x4b (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_SIGNATURE)
```
(^1) 0x21 (Block size in words)
1 0x00 (pad)
1 0x01 (PICOBIN_SIGNATURE_SECP256K1)
1 4 Public Key (lowest significant 32 bits)
... ... ...
16 4 Public Key (highest significant 32 bits)
17 4 Signature of hash (lowest significant 32 bits)
... ... ...
32 4 Signature of hash (highest significant 32 bits)
This SIGNATURE item is paired with the most recent HASH_DEF item (Section 5.9.2.2) which defines what the hash value
whose signature is checked.

#### 5.9.3. Image definition items

##### 5.9.3.1. IMAGE_DEF item

The IMAGE_DEF item must be the first item within an Image Definition:
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x42 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_IMAGE_TYPE)
1 0x01 (Block size in words)
2 image_type_flags
The flags are defined in the SDK in picobin.h in the SDK, but are summarised here:
Bits Field Values
0-3 Image Type 0 IMAGE_TYPE_INVALID
1 IMAGE_TYPE_EXE : Image is executable
2 IMAGE_TYPE_DATA : Image is valid, but is not intended to be executed
3 reserved
5.9. Metadata block details 421

```
Bits Field Values
The remaining bits are specific to the Image Type Values are only currently defined for the EXE Image Type:
4-5 EXE Security 0 EXE_SECURITY_UNSPECIFIED
1 EXE_SECURITY_NS : Image runs in Non-secure mode
2 EXE_SECURITY_S : Image runs in Secure mode
3 reserved
6-7 reserved 0
8-10 EXE CPU 0 EXE_CPU_ARM : Image is for the Arm architecture
1 EXE_CPU_RISCV : Image is for the RISC-V architecture
2-7 reserved
11 reserved 0
12-14 EXE CHIP 0 EXE_CHIP_RP2040
1 EXE_CHIP_RP2350
2-7 reserved
15 EXE TBYB 0 not set
1 EXE_TBYB : Image is flagged for "Try Before You Buy"
```
##### 5.9.3.2. LOAD_MAP item

```
Optional item with a similar representation to the ELF program header. This is used both to define the content to hash,
and also to "load" data before image execution. For example, a secure flash binary can be loaded into RAM prior to both
signature check and execution.
The load map is a collection of runtime address, physical address, size and flags.
```
1. For a "packaged" binary, the information tells the bootrom where to load the code/data.
2. For a hashed or signed binary, the runtime addresses and size indicate code/data that must be included in the
    hash to be verified or signature checked.

#####  NOTE

If the runtime_address is in equal to the storage_address, then data is never copied, it is just hashed in place.
Explanation of terms:
physical address
Where the data is stored in the logical address space of the image. For instance, the start of a flash image, even if
stored in a partition, could have a physical address of 0x10000000. The closest ELF concept is LMA.
runtime address
The address of the data at runtime. The closest ELF concept is VMA.
storage address
an absolute location where the data is stored in flash. Not necessarily the same as physical address for flash when
partitions are in use.
RP2350 uses physical addresses in the LOAD_MAP, not storage addresses, since this data is written by a tool working on
the ELF which will not necessarily know where the binary will finally be stored in flash.
This serves several purposes:
5.9. Metadata block details 422

```
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x06 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_LOAD_MAP)
2 1 + num_entries * 3 (Block size in words)
1 absolute:1, num_entries:7
1-3 Load Map Entry 0
```
(^4) • if absolute == 0
storage_start_address_rel (storage start address relative to the address of this
LOAD_MAP item)

- if^ absolute^ == 1
    storage_start_address (absolute storage start address)
Note: If this value is 0x00000000 irrespective of the value of the absolute flag, then the runtime
address range is filled with zeros. In this case, the 32 bit size itself is hashed rather than size
zero bytes.
4 runtime_start_address (absolute runtime start address)

(^4) • if absolute == 0
size (of memory range in bytes)

- if^ absolute^ == 1
    storage_end_address (absolute storage end address)
(4-6) (Load Map Entry 1)
... ...
All addresses must be word aligned, and sizes a multiple of 4. In RP2350 A3 and earlier, the bootrom allowed sizes
which weren’t multiples of 4 in some cases, but may not have functioned correctly.

###### 5.9.3.2.1. XIP pinning via LOAD_MAP

Normally, when entering a binary, the XIP cache is un-pinned and flushed. This makes sense both for entering a flash
binary, and for security purposes.
If, however, you have a non-flash binary with code or data in the XIP RAM address space, then you need to add a special
LOAD_MAP entry to indicate to the bootrom that the XIP contents should be pinned.
Any load-map entry (with storage_address == runtime_address) and a valid size of greater than zero will suffice, as for
example in this simple load map:
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x06 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_LOAD_MAP)
2 0x04 (Block size in words)
1 0x81 (absolute == 1, num_entries == 1)
1-3 Load Map Entry 0
4 XIP_SRAM_BASE (storage_start_address)
4 XIP_SRAM_BASE (runtime_start_address)
4 0x04 (size in bytes)
5.9. Metadata block details 423

##### 5.9.3.3. VECTOR_TABLE item

```
Optional Arm only item for that specifies the location of the initial Arm vector table. The entry_point/initial_sp will be
taken from here if present (unless there is also an ENTRY_POINT Item). If there is no ENTRY_POINT or VECTOR_TABLE Item, then
the Arm vector table is assumed to be at the start of the image.
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x03 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_VECTOR_TABLE)
1 0x02 (Block size in words)
2 0x0000 (pad)
```
(^1 4) Vector table (runtime) address

#####  NOTE

The VECTOR_TABLE Item is ignored on RISC-V.

##### 5.9.3.4. ENTRY_POINT item

```
Optional item with info on initial PC, SP, and optionally the SP limit
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x44 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_ENTRY_POINT)
1 0x03 or 0x04 (Block size in words)
2 0x0000 (pad)
1 4 Inital PC (runtime) address (aka entry point)
2 4 Initial SP address (aka stack pointer)
```
(3) (^4) Optional SP limit address (aka stack limit)

##### 5.9.3.5. ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA item

Optional item that allow for binaries that aren’t intended to be run at 0x10000000. Note that this delta is in addition to the
roll resulting from the binary being stored in a partition in flash.
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x05 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA)
1 0x02 (Block size in words)
2 0x0000 (pad)
1 4 signed 32 bit delta
The delta is the number of bytes into the image that 0x10000000 should be mapped.
If positive, the delta must be a multiple of 4 kB, and allows for "skipping over" other data before the start of the binary. If
negative, the delta must be a multiple of 4 MB, and allows for running flash binaries linked to run at 0x10400000, 0x01080000
and 0x010c0000 as well as the standard 0x10000000
5.9. Metadata block details 424

#####  NOTE

The ROLLING_WINDOW_DELTA Item is ignored for non-flash binaries.

#### 5.9.4. Partition table items

```
Partition tables allows dividing the 32 MB flash region (2 × 16 MB) into partitions. Permissions and other partition
attributes may be specified for each partition, along with permissions for the un-partitioned space.
The permission specify read/write access for Secure code, Non-secure code, and "NSBoot" which refers to the boot
loader (and PICOBOOT)
```
 (^) NOTE
These permissions are only advisory to Secure code, however they are respected by flash_op(), the PICOBOOT flash
access commands, and UF2 downloads.

##### 5.9.4.1. PARTITION_TABLE item

##### 5.9.4.2. Partition location, permissions, and flags

Two common words are stored in the partition table for both un-partitioned space and each partition. These common
words describe the size/location, along with access permissions and various flags.
The permission fields are repeated in both words, hence the two words are permissions_and_location and
permissions_and_flags.

#### 5.9.5. Minimum viable image metadata

```
A minimum amount of metadata (a valid IMAGE_DEF block) must be embedded in any binary for the bootrom to recognise
it as a valid program image, as opposed to, for example, blank flash contents or a disconnected flash device. This must
appear within the first 4 kB of a flash image, or anywhere in a RAM or OTP image.
Unlike RP2040, there is no requirement for flash binaries to have a checksummed "boot2" flash setup function at flash
address 0. The RP2350 bootrom performs a simple best-effort XIP setup during flash scanning, and a flash-resident
program can continue executing in this state, or can choose to reconfigure the QSPI interface at a later time for best
performance.
```
##### 5.9.5.1. Minimum Arm IMAGE_DEF

```
Assuming CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE is clear, the minimum valid IMAGE_DEF is the following 20-byte sequence:
Word LE Value Bytes Description
0 0xffffded3 4 PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_START
1 0x10210142 1 0x42(item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_IMAGE_TYPE)
1 0x01 (Item is 1 word in size)
2 0x1021
(PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_IMAGE_TYPE_AS_BITS(EXE) |
PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_EXE_SECURITY_AS_BITS(S) |
PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_EXE_CPU_AS_BITS(Arm) |
PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_EXE_CHIP_AS_BITS(RP23500))
2 0x000001ff 1 0xff(size_type == 1, item_type_ == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_2BS_LAST)
2 0x0001 (size)
1 0x00 (pad)
3 0x00000000 4 Relative pointer to next block in block loop - 0x00000000 means link to self (a loop
containing just this block)
4 0xab123579 4 PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_END
The LE Value column indicates a 32-bit little-endian value that should appear verbatim in your program image.
Since the above block does not specify an explicit entry point, the bootrom will assume the binary starts with a Cortex-M
vector table, and enter via the reset handler and initial stack pointer specified in that table (offsets +4 and +0 bytes into
the table). An explicit vector table pointer can be provided by a PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_VECTOR_TABLE item, or the entry
point can be specified directly by a PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_ENTRY_POINT item.
```
##### 5.9.5.2. Minimum RISC-V IMAGE_DEF

The minimum valid IMAGE_DEF is the following 20-byte sequence:
5.9. Metadata block details 428

```
Word LE Value Bytes Description
0 0xffffded3 4 PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_START
1 0x11010142 1 0x42(item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_IMAGE_TYPE)
1 0x01 (Item is 1 word in size)
2 0x1101
(PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_IMAGE_TYPE_AS_BITS(EXE) |
PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_EXE_CPU_AS_BITS(RISCV) |
PICOBIN_IMAGE_TYPE_EXE_CHIP_AS_BITS(RP23500))
2 0x000001ff 1 0xff(size_type == 1, item_type_ == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_2BS_LAST)
2 0x0001 (size)
1 0x00 (pad)
```
3 0x00000000 (^4) Relative pointer to next block in block loop - 0x00000000 means link to self (a loop
containing just this block)
4 0xab123579 4 PICOBIN_BLOCK_MARKER_END
The LE Value column indicates a 32-bit little-endian value that should appear verbatim in your program image.
Since the above block does not specify an explicit entry point, the bootrom will enter the binary at its lowest address,
which is the default behaviour on RISC-V. This default entry point can be overridden by a
PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_ENTRY_POINT item. Note that PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_1BS_VECTOR_TABLE is not valid on RISC-V, as unlike
Cortex-M the RISC-V vector table does not define the program entry point.

## 5.10. Example boot scenarios

This section describes the setup and configuration steps for various different boot scenarios.

#### 5.10.1. Secure boot

To enable secure boot on RP2350, you must:

1. Set the SHA-256 hashes of the boot keys you will be using in BOOTKEY0_0 onwards
2. Set bits in BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_VALID for the keys you will be using
3. Optionally set bits in BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_INVALID for all unused keys — this is recommended to prevent a
    malicious actor installing their own boot keys at a later date
4. Set CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE to turn on secure boot.

 (^) NOTE
These steps are the minimum for enabling secure boot support in the bootrom. See Section 10.5 for additional steps
you must take to fully secure your device, such as disabling hardware debug.
All of the above can be achieved with picotool. For example, when signing using picotool seal you can add an OTP JSON
output file, to which it will add the relevant OTP field values to enable secure boot (BOOTKEY0_0,
BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_VALID and CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE):
5.10. Example boot scenarios 429

```
$ picotool seal --sign unsigned.elf signed.elf private.pem /path/to/otp.json
To configure the SDK to output this OTP JSON file when signing, add the following command to your CMakeLists.txt:
pico_set_otp_key_output_file(target_name /path/to/otp.json)
You can then issue the following command to write this OTP JSON file to the device, thus enabling secure boot:
$ picotool otp load /path/to/otp.json
Once secure boot is enabled, the bootrom verifies signatures of images from all supported media: flash, OTP, and
images preloaded into SRAM via the UART and USB bootloaders. At this point you lose the ability to run unsigned
images; during development you may find it more convenient to leave secure boot disabled. The next section describes
the generation of signed images to run on a secure-boot-enabled device.
```
#### 5.10.2. Signed images

#####  TIP

This section refers to the concepts of block loops and image definitions (and the associated IMAGE_DEF data
structure) described in Section 5.1. You should read the bootrom concepts section before this one.
An example of an image (and its block loop) produced by the SDK is shown below.
5.10. Example boot scenarios 430

Block
Loop
IMAGE_DEF Item
IGNORED Item
Vector table
Data
Initial Metadata Block
(must be in first 4kB)
Empty Block
(placed at the end by
default to catch
overwrite at the end
of the binary)
Code
The first block must be within the first 4 kB of the image, and is an IMAGE_DEF block describing the image. This block is
linking to an empty block at the end of the image, that is included in the block loop to help detect partially written
binaries. If the end of the image is missing or overwritten, then the block loop not be properly closed and will be
considered invalid.
picotool can be used to sign a binary, in which case it modifies the image as follows:
5.10. Example boot scenarios 431

IMAGE_DEF Item
IGNORED Item
LOAD_MAP Item
HASH_DEF Item
SIGNATURE Item
HASH_VALUE Item
Block
Loop
LOAD_MAP
entry covers
this region
or
IMAGE_DEF Item
(this will be
superceded by later
IMAGE_DEF in the
block loop)
Vector table
Data
Signature Block
Initial Metadata Block
(must be in first 4kB)
Code
Note that the marker block at the end of the image has been replaced with a new IMAGE_DEF block including the first
block’s information along with additional new information. The new information includes the signature (or hash value if
hashing only), along with a LOAD_MAP entry indicating the regions of the image that are signed or hashed.
At runtime, the bootrom will pick the last valid IMAGE_DEF in the block loop as the one to boot.
Signing requires a SHA-256 hash of the data specified in the LOAD_MAP, along with the words of the block specified by the
HASH_VALUE Item (which must include the first word of the SIGNATURE Item). This hash is then signed with an ECDSA
secp256k1 private key, to produce the 64 byte signature stored in the SIGNATURE Item.
For secure boot, it is recommended to use packaged SRAM binaries instead of flash binaries, as the signature check is
only performed during boot, so a malicious actor with physical access could replace the data on the external flash after
the signature check to run unsigned code.
To sign and/or hash a binary in the SDK, you can add the following functions to your CMakeLists.txt file:
pico_sign_binary(target_name /path/to/keyfile.pem)
pico_hash_binary(target_name)
This will invoke the picotool seal command to sign and/or hash your binary when you call pico_add_extra_outputs. You
can manually invoke picotool seal to sign and/or hash a binary using:
$ picotool seal --sign --hash unsigned.elf signed.elf private.pem
5.10. Example boot scenarios 432

#### 5.10.3. Packaged binaries

```
A packaged binary is an SRAM/XIP RAM-only binary that has been post-processed for storage in flash. To create a
packaged SRAM binary, you can take a binary compiled to run in SRAM (no_flash binary in the SDK) and add a relative
LOAD_MAP Item into the IMAGE_DEF block, with the runtime address(es) in SRAM. The subsequent binary can then be run
normally from RAM, or stored in flash to be loaded into RAM by the bootrom. This LOAD_MAP item will be added to all
binaries when using picotool seal.
To package binaries in the SDK, add the following to your CMakeLists.txt file. This will target the UF2 file to the start of
flash when dragged and dropped, and will invoke picotool seal to add an appropriate LOAD_MAP.
pico_package_uf2_output(target_name 0x10000000)
Alternatively, you can use an absolute LOAD_MAP, with the storage_address in flash and the runtime_address in SRAM.
However, these binaries can only run after storing in flash and can’t be booted directly in SRAM for debugging.
For example, if you have a binary compiled to run at 0x20000000 of length 0x8000, and a metadata block at the end of the
binary containing the LOAD_MAP as the second Item (after the IMAGE_DEF, which means the LOAD_MAP is 8 bytes into the
block), then the relative LOAD_MAP would be:
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x06 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_LOAD_MAP)
2 0x04 (Block size in words)
1 0x01 (absolute == 0, num_entries == 1)
1-3 Load Map Entry 0
4 -0x8008 = 0xFFFF7FF8 (storage_start_address_rel)
4 0x20000000 (runtime_start_address)
4 0x8000 (size in bytes)
The absolute LOAD_MAP would be:
Word Bytes Value
0 1 0x06 (size_flag == 0, item_type == PICOBIN_BLOCK_ITEM_LOAD_MAP)
2 0x04 (Block size in words)
1 0x81 (absolute == 1, num_entries == 1)
1-3 Load Map Entry 0
4 0x10000000 (storage_start_address)
4 0x20000000 (runtime_start_address)
4 0x20008000 (runtime_end_address)
```
#### 5.10.4. A/B booting

This is a common boot scenario, to be able to update the software without overwriting it. A simple partition layout
would be:
5.10. Example boot scenarios 433

```
Partition 0
Accepts UF2 Families: rp2350-arm-s, rp2350-riscv
Partition 1
Accepts UF2 Families: rp2350-arm-s, rp2350-riscv
Link Type: "A"
Link Value: 0
This is a partition table with 2 partitions, where partition 0 is the A partition of partition 1 (which is thus the B partition).
```
#####  NOTE

```
To avoid confusion, it is a recommended best practice to have the same permissions for both partitions, and for
both partitions to accept the same UF2 families. The bootrom will only look at the UF2 families from the A partition
when deciding if a given A/B pair accepts a particular family, and will not allow download to partition A even if it is
writable if partition B isn’t.
When dragging a UF2 to the device, it will target whichever partition is not currently booting. The bootrom will then
perform a FLASH_UPDATE boot into the new binary (see Section 5.1.16)
```
#####  NOTE

When starting with blank A/B partitions, the first download actually goes into partition B.
To create the partition table above with picotool partition create, the following json could be used:
{
"version": [1, 0],
"unpartitioned": {
"families": ["absolute"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
}
},
"partitions": [
{
"name": "Example A",
"id": 0,
"size": "2044K",
"families": ["rp2350-arm-s", "rp2350-riscv"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
}
},
{
"name": "Example B",
"id": 1,
"size": "2044K",
"families": ["rp2350-arm-s", "rp2350-riscv"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
},
"link": ["a", 0]
5.10. Example boot scenarios 434

```
}
]
}
This can then be installed onto the device using picotool load, or UF2 drag and drop if you output the partition table as a
UF2 file.
```
#### 5.10.5. A/B booting with owned partitions

The concept of owned partitions applies when:

- you require separate data partitions (which generally won’t contain a block loop), but
- you would like these to be associated with a specific boot partition in an A/B pair
An example partition table for this scenario would be:
Partition 0
Accepts Families: rp2350-arm-s, rp2350-riscv
Partition 1
Accepts Families: rp2350-arm-s, rp2350-riscv
Link Type: "A"
Link Value: 0
Partition 2
Accepts Families: data
Link Type: "Owner"
Link Value: 0
ignored_during_arm_boot: true
ignored_during_riscv_boot: true
Partition 3
Accepts Families: data
Link Type: "A"
Link Value: 2
ignored_during_arm_boot: true
ignored_during_riscv_boot: true
This is a partition table with 4 partitions. As before, partition 0 is the A partition of partition 1 (which is thus a B
partition). Additionally, partition 2 is the A partition of partition 3 (which is thus a B partition). Finally, partition 0 is the
"owner" partition of partition 2.
As a result partitions 2 and 3 "belong to" partitions 0 and 1.
When downloading a UF2 into an owned partition, the bootloader will select which partition out of 2/3 it goes to target
based on which partition out of 0/1 is currently booting. For example, if partition 1 is currently booting (due to having a
higher version than partition 0), then any UF2 downloads with the data family ID will target partition 3.

#####  TIP

There is a flag in each partition that you can use to swap the "affinity", for example, to have the data family ID target
partition 2 instead of partition 3 in the scenario above.
5.10. Example boot scenarios 435

#####  NOTE

Only the get_uf2_target_partition() bootrom function considers owner partitions. The pick_ab_partition() function
always pick solely based on the A/B partition it is passed, in other words if passed partition 2, it would not look at
partitions 0 and 1.
To create this partition table using picotool partition create, the following JSON could be used:
{
"version": [1, 0],
"unpartitioned": {
"families": ["absolute"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
}
},
"partitions": [
{
"name": "Example A",
"id": 0,
"size": 128k,
"families": ["rp2350-arm-s", "rp2350-riscv"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
}
},
{
"name": "Example B",
"id": 1,
"size": 128k,
"families": ["rp2350-arm-s", "rp2350-riscv"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
},
"link": ["a", 0]
},
{
"name": "Example a",
"id": 2,
"size": 20k,
"families": ["data"],
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
},
"link": ["owner", 0],
"ignored_during_arm_boot": true,
"ignored_during_riscv_boot": true
},
{
"name": "Example b",
"id": 3,
"size": 20k,
"families": ["data"],
5.10. Example boot scenarios 436

```
"permissions": {
"secure": "rw",
"nonsecure": "rw",
"bootloader": "rw"
},
"link": ["a", 2],
"ignored_during_arm_boot": true,
"ignored_during_riscv_boot": true
}
]
}
This can then be installed onto the device using picotool load, or UF2 drag and drop if you output the partition table as a
UF2 file.
```
#### 5.10.6. Custom bootloader

```
In this scenario, a bootloader is run before booting into an image. This could perform additional validation, or set up
peripherals for use by the image. For this to work, the block loop must contain both an IMAGE_DEF for the bootloader and
a PARTITION_TABLE to define the flash layout.
In this example, we want to have A / B versions of the bootloader, so we use both slot 0 and slot 1. See Section 5.1.15
for more details of this, as you may well need to increase the size of slot 0 in order to fit the bootloader.
```
 (^) WARNING
Making a slot size change is not reversible, so feel free to leave out slot 1 if you try this in practice.
An example flash layout might resemble the following:
Slot 0 (0x00000000-0x00008000)
Bootloader Image 0
Partition Table 0
Slot 1 (0x00008000-0x00010000)
Bootloader Image 1
Partition Table 1
Partition 0 (0x00010000-0x00020000)
Binary A
Partition 1 (0x00020000-0x00030000)
Link Type: "A"
Link Value: 0
Binary B
The block loop with both IMAGE_DEF and PARTITION_TABLE might look like this (after signing in this case):
5.10. Example boot scenarios 437

```
IMAGE_DEF Item
IGNORED Item
LOAD_MAP Item
HASH_DEF Item
SIGNATURE Item
HASH_VALUE Item
Block
Loop
LOAD_MAP
entry covers
this region
or
IMAGE_DEF Item
(this will be
superceded by later
IMAGE_DEF in the
block loop)
Vector table
Data
Partition Table
Signature Block
Initial Metadata Block
(must be in first 4kB)
Code
Note the 3 blocks in the block loop:
```
1. Original block in first 4 kB (contents doesn’t matter, as it will be superseded by the later IMAGE_DEF)
2. PARTITION_TABLE at end of binary
3. Signed IMAGE_DEF

 (^) NOTE
It is possible to sign both the PARTITION_TABLE and the IMAGE_DEF separately, however for the fastest boot speed, the
bootrom also allows you to use a "covering" LOAD_MAP in the IMAGE_DEF. As long as the LOAD_MAP defined area to be
hashed/signed includes the entirety of the PARTITION_TABLE block, the "covering" signature is used to validate the
PARTITION_TABLE too.
For the bootloader to find and launch a new image, it may wish to utilise various bootrom methods:

- get_partition_table_info() to get the full partition information.
- or get_partition_table_info() with^ SINGLE_PARTITION, the chosen partition number, and^ PARTITION_LOCATION_AND_FLAGS, to
    get the address of a single partition
5.10. Example boot scenarios 438

```
uint32_t partition_info[3];
get_partition_table_info(partition_info, 3, PT_INFO_PARTITION_LOCATION_AND_FLAGS
| PT_INFO_SINGLE_PARTITION | (boot_partition << 24));
uint16_t first_sector_number = (partition_info[1]
& PICOBIN_PARTITION_LOCATION_FIRST_SECTOR_BITS)
>> PICOBIN_PARTITION_LOCATION_FIRST_SECTOR_LSB;
uint16_t last_sector_number = (partition_info[1]
& PICOBIN_PARTITION_LOCATION_LAST_SECTOR_BITS)
>> PICOBIN_PARTITION_LOCATION_LAST_SECTOR_LSB;
uint32_t data_start_addr = first_sector_number * 0x1000;
uint32_t data_end_addr = (last_sector_number + 1) * 0x1000;
uint32_t data_size = data_end_addr - data_start_addr;
```
- get_sys_info() with^ BOOT_INFO, to get the^ flash_update_boot_window_base^ if any:
    uint32_t sys_info[5];
    get_sys_info(sys_info, 5*4, SYS_INFO_BOOT_INFO);
    uint32_t flash_update_boot_window_base = sys_info[3];
- pick_ab_partition() to pick the boot partition between A/B partitions if desired:
    uint8_t boot_partition = pick_ab_partition(workarea, 0xC00, 0,
    flash_update_boot_window_base);
- or get_b_partition() to find the other partition directly.
- chain_image() with^ data_start_addr^ and^ data_size, to boot a chosen image:
    // note a negative 3rd parameter indicates to chain_image that the image is being chanined as
    // part of a "flash update" boot, so TBYB and/or version downgrade may be in play
    chain_image( workarea,
       0xc00,
(XIP_BASE + data_start_addr) * (info.boot_type == BOOT_TYPE_FLASH_UPDATE? -1 :
    1),
       data_size
    );

 (^) NOTE
The workarea used must not overlap the image being chained into, so beware SRAM or packaged binaries. If the
binary overlaps the workarea, the results are undefined, but hardly likely to be good.

#### 5.10.7. OTP bootloader

This is similar to the custom bootloader scenario, but it will be stored in the OTP and will run in SRAM.
One possible use case could place decryption code into OTP which decrypts an executable image from a flash partition
into RAM.
The entire bootloader will need to fit in the OTP rows from 0x0C0 to 0xF48 to avoid interfering with other reserved OTP
functionality, giving a maximum size of 7440 bytes (2 bytes per ECC row). If some boot keys and OTP keys are unused,
this region can extend slightly on either end.
5.10. Example boot scenarios 439

```
The OTP bootloader itself should be stored in ECC format, starting from the row set in OTPBOOT_SRC with size set in
OTPBOOT_LEN. When booting, it will be loaded into the address specified in OTPBOOT_DST0 and OTPBOOT_DST1,
which must be in the main SRAM. The bootloader must fulfil the same criteria as a standard image: it must include an
IMAGE_DEF, which must be signed if secure boot is enabled.
Once the OTP bootloader has been written to OTP, and the OTPBOOT_SRC, OTPBOOT_LEN, OTPBOOT_DST0 and
OTPBOOT_DST1 set, OTP booting can be enabled by setting BOOT_FLAGS0.ENABLE_OTP_BOOT. If the OTP image fails
the bootrom’s launch checks, then, by default, boot continues along the normal flash boot path. You can prevent this by
setting BOOT_FLAGS0.DISABLE_FLASH_BOOT.
```
#####  WARNING

Take extreme care when writing an OTP bootloader. Once the ECC rows are written, they cannot be modified.

#### 5.10.8. Rollback versions and bootloaders

#####  WARNING

```
Ignoring the advice in this section could render your device unable to boot.
For bootloaders that need to chain into executable images with rollback versions on a secured RP2350, you must use
separate OTP rows for:
```
- The bootloader rollback version
- The chained executable image’s rollback version
Otherwise, bumping the version of the chained executable image renders the OTP bootloader and your device unable to
boot.
You must also make sure that both the bootloader and the executable image have non-zero rollback versions, as the
OTP flags relating to requiring rollback versions are global. Failure to do so will render your device unable to boot.
We recommend using the DEFAULT_BOOT_VERSION0 and DEFAULT_BOOT_VERSION1 rows for the binary’s rollback
version, and selecting some other unused rows in the OTP for the bootloader’s rollback version.
5.10. Example boot scenarios 440
