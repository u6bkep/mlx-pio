# Chapter 11. PIO

## 11.1. Overview

## RP2350 contains 3 identical PIO blocks. Each PIO block has dedicated connections to the bus fabric, GPIO and interrupt

## controller. The diagram for a single PIO block is shown below in Figure 44.

## The programmable input/output block (PIO) is a versatile hardware interface. It can support a variety of IO standards,

## including:

## • 8080 and 6800 parallel bus

## • I2C

## • 3-pin I2S

## • SDIO

## • SPI, DSPI, QSPI

## • UART

## • DPI or VGA (via resistor DAC)

## PIO is programmable in the same sense as a processor. There are three PIO blocks with four state machines. Each can

## independently execute sequential programs to manipulate GPIOs and transfer data. Unlike a general purpose processor,

## PIO state machines are specialised for IO, with a focus on determinism, precise timing, and close integration with fixed-

## function hardware. Each state machine is equipped with:

## • Two 32-bit shift registers (either direction, any shift count)

## • Two 32-bit scratch registers

## • 4 ×^ 32-bit bus FIFO in each direction (TX/RX), reconfigurable as 8^ ×^ 32 in a single direction

## • Fractional clock divider (16 integer, 8 fractional bits)

## 11.1. Overview 876

- Flexible GPIO mapping
- DMA interface (sustained throughput up to 1 word per clock from system DMA)
- IRQ flag set/clear/status

###### Each state machine, along with its supporting hardware, occupies approximately the same silicon area as a standard

###### serial interface block, such as an SPI or I2C controller. However, PIO state machines can be configured and

###### reconfigured dynamically to implement numerous different interfaces.

###### Making state machines programmable in a software-like manner, rather than a fully configurable logic fabric like a

###### complex programmable logic device (CPLD), allows more hardware interfaces to be offered in the same cost and power

###### envelope. This also presents a more familiar programming model, and simpler tool flow, to those who wish to exploit

###### PIO’s full flexibility by programming it directly, rather than using a pre-made interface from the PIO library.

###### PIO is performant as well as flexible, thanks to a carefully selected set of fixed-function hardware inside each state

###### machine. When outputting DPI, PIO can sustain 360 Mb/s during the active scanline period when running from a

###### 48 MHz system clock. In this example, one state machine handles frame/scanline timing and generates the pixel clock.

###### Another handles the pixel data and unpacks run-length-encoded scanlines.

###### State machines' inputs and outputs are mapped to up to 32 GPIOs (limited to 30 GPIOs for RP2350). All state machines

###### have independent, simultaneous access to any GPIO. For example, the standard UART code allows TX, RX, CTS and RTS to

###### be any four arbitrary GPIOs, and I2C permits the same for SDA and SCL. The amount of freedom available depends on how

###### exactly a given PIO program chooses to use PIO’s pin mapping resources, but at the minimum, an interface can be

###### freely shifted up or down by some number of GPIOs.

#### 11.1.1. Changes from RP

###### RP2350 adds the following new registers and controls:

- DBG_CFGINFO.VERSION indicates the PIO version, to allow PIO feature detection at runtime.

### ◦ This 4-bit field was reserved-0 on RP2040 (indicating version 0), and reads as 1 on RP2350.

- GPIOBASE adds support for more than 32 GPIOs per PIO block.

### ◦ Each PIO block is still limited to 32 GPIOs at a time, but GPIOBASE selects^ which^ 32.

- CTRL.NEXT_PIO_MASK and CTRL.PREV_PIO_MASK apply some CTRL register operations to state machines in

###### neighbouring PIO blocks simultaneously.

### ◦ CTRL.NEXTPREV_SM_DISABLE stops PIO state machines in multiple PIO blocks simultaneously.

### ◦ CTRL.NEXTPREV_SM_ENABLE starts PIO state machines in multiple PIO blocks simultaneously.

### ◦ CTRL.NEXTPREV_CLKDIV_RESTART synchronises the clock dividers of PIO state machines in multiple PIO

###### blocks

- SM0_SHIFTCTRL.IN_COUNT masks unneeded IN-mapped pins to zero.

### ◦ This is useful for^ MOV x, PINS^ instructions, which previously always returned a full rotated 32-bit value.

- IRQ0_INTE and IRQ1_INTE now expose all eight SM IRQ flags to system-level interrupts (not just the lower four).
- Registers starting from RXF0_PUTGET0 expose each RX FIFO’s internal storage registers for random read^ or^ write

###### access from the system,

### ◦ The new^ FJOIN_RX_PUT^ FIFO join mode enables random writes from the state machine, and random reads from

###### the system (for implementing status registers).

### ◦ The new^ FJOIN_RX_GET^ FIFO join mode enables random reads from the state machine, and random writes from

###### the system (for implementing control registers).

### ◦ Setting both^ FJOIN_RX_PUT^ and^ FJOIN_RX_GET^ enables random read^ and^ write access from the state machine, but

###### disables system access.

###### 11.1. Overview 877

###### RP2350 adds the following new instruction features:

- Adds^ PINCTRL_JMP_PIN^ as a source for the^ WAIT^ instruction, plus an offset in the range 0-3.

### ◦ This gives^ WAIT^ pin arguments a per-SM mapping that is independent of the IN-mapped pins.

- Adds^ PINDIRS^ as a destination for^ MOV.

### ◦ This allows changing the direction of all OUT-mapped pins with a single instruction:^ MOV PINDIRS, NULL^ or^ MOV

PINDIRS, ~NULL

- Adds SM IRQ flags as a source for^ MOV x, STATUS

### ◦ This allows branching (as well as blocking) on the assertion of SM IRQ flags.

- Extends^ IRQ^ instruction encoding to allow state machines to set, clear and observe IRQ flags from different PIO

###### blocks.

### ◦ There is no delay penalty for cross-PIO IRQ flags: an^ IRQ^ on one state machine is observable to all state

###### machines on the next cycle.

- Adds the^ FJOIN_RX_GET^ FIFO mode.

### ◦ A new^ MOV^ encoding reads any of the four RX FIFO storage registers into^ OSR.

### ◦ This instruction permits random reads of the four FIFO entries, indexed either by instruction bits or the^ Y

###### scratch register.

- Adds the^ FJOIN_RX_PUT^ FIFO mode.

### ◦ A new^ MOV^ encoding writes the^ ISR^ into any of the four RX FIFO storage registers.

### ◦ The registers are indexed either by instruction bits or the^ Y^ scratch register.

###### RP2350 adds the following security features:

- Limits Non-secure PIOs (set to via ACCESSCTRL) to observation of only Non-secure GPIOs. Attempting to read a

###### Secure GPIO returns a 0.

- Disables cross-PIO functionality (IRQs,^ CTRL_NEXTPREV^ operations) between Non-secure PIO blocks (those which

###### permit Non-secure access according to ACCESSCTRL) and Secure-only blocks (those which do not).

###### RP2350 includes the following general improvements:

- Increased the number of PIO blocks from two to three (8^ →^ 12 state machines).
- Improved GPIO input/output delay and skew.
- Reduced DMA request (DREQ) latency by one cycle vs RP2040.

## 11.2. Programmer’s model

###### The four state machines execute from shared instruction memory. System software loads programs into this memory,

###### configures the state machines and IO mapping, and then sets the state machines running. PIO programs come from

###### various sources: assembled directly by the user, drawn from the PIO library, or generated programmatically by user

###### software.

###### From this point on, state machines are generally autonomous, and system software interacts through DMA, interrupts

###### and control registers, as with other peripherals on RP2350. For more complex interfaces, PIO provides a small but

###### flexible set of primitives which allow system software to be more hands-on with state machine control flow.

###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 878

registers, and the pins.

machine’s execution

#### 11.2.1. PIO programs

###### PIO state machines execute short binary programs.

###### Programs for common interfaces, such as UART, SPI, or I2C, are available in the PIO library. In many cases, it is not

###### necessary to write PIO programs. However, the PIO is much more flexible when programmed directly, supporting a wide

###### variety of interfaces which may not have been foreseen by its designers.

###### The PIO has a total of nine instructions: JMP, WAIT, IN, OUT, PUSH, PULL, MOV, IRQ, and SET. For more information about these

###### instructions, see Section 11.4.

###### Though the PIO only has a total of nine instructions, it would be difficult to edit PIO program binaries by hand. PIO

###### assembly is a textual format, describing a PIO program, where each command corresponds to one instruction in the

###### output binary. The following code snippet contains an example program written in in PIO assembly:

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.pio Lines 8 - 13
8 .program squarewave
9 set pindirs, 1 ; Set pin to output
10 again:
11 set pins, 1 [1] ; Drive pin high and then delay for one cycle
12 set pins, 0 ; Drive pin low
13 jmp again ; Set PC to label `again`
```
###### The PIO assembler is included with the SDK, and is called pioasm. This program processes a PIO assembly input text file,

###### which may contain multiple programs, and writes out the assembled programs ready for use. For the SDK, these

###### assembled programs are emitted as C headers, containing constant arrays.

###### For more information, see Section 11.3.

#### 11.2.2. Control flow

###### On every system clock cycle, each state machine fetches, decodes and executes one instruction. Each instruction takes

###### precisely one cycle, unless it explicitly stalls (such as the WAIT instruction). Instructions may insert a delay of up to 31

###### cycles before the next instruction execute, to help write cycle-exact programs.

###### The program counter, or PC, points to the location in the instruction memory being executed on this cycle. Generally, PC

###### increments by one each cycle, wrapping at the end of the instruction memory. Jump instructions are an exception and

###### explicitly provide the next value that PC will take.

###### Our example assembly program (listed as .program squarewave above) shows both of these concepts in practice. It drives

###### a 50/50 duty cycle square wave with a period of four cycles onto a GPIO. Using some other features (e.g. side-set) this

###### can be made as low as two cycles.

###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 879

#####  NOTE

###### Side-set is where a state machine drives a small number of GPIOs in addition to the main side effects of the

###### instruction it executes. It’s described fully in Section 11.5.1.

###### The system has write-only access to the instruction memory, which is used to load programs. The clock divider slows

###### the state machine’s execution by a constant factor, represented as a 16.8 fixed-point fractional number. In the following

###### example, if a clock division of 2.5 were programmed, the square wave would have a period of cycles.

###### This is useful for setting a precise baud rate for a serial interface, such as a UART.

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 34 - 38
34 // Load the assembled program directly into the PIO's instruction memory.
35 // Each PIO instance has a 32-slot instruction memory, which all 4 state
36 // machines can see. The system has write-only access.
37 for (uint i = 0; i < count_of(squarewave_program_instructions); ++i)
38 pio->instr_mem[i] = squarewave_program_instructions[i];
```
###### The following code fragments are part of a complete code example which drives a 12.5 MHz square wave out of GPIO 0

###### (or any other pins we might choose to map). We can also use pins WAIT PIN instruction to stall a state machine’s

###### execution for some amount of time, or a JMP PIN instruction to branch on the state of a pin, so control flow can vary

###### based on pin state.

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 42 - 47
42 // Configure state machine 0 to run at sysclk/2.5. The state machines can
43 // run as fast as one instruction per clock cycle, but we can scale their
44 // speed down uniformly to meet some precise frequency target, e.g. for a
45 // UART baud rate. This register has 16 integer divisor bits and 8
46 // fractional divisor bits.
47 pio->sm[0].clkdiv = (uint32_t) (2.5f * (1 << 16));
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 51 - 59
51 // There are five pin mapping groups (out, in, set, side-set, jmp pin)
52 // which are used by different instructions or in different circumstances.
53 // Here we're just using SET instructions. Configure state machine 0 SETs
54 // to affect GPIO 0 only; then configure GPIO0 to be controlled by PIO0,
55 // as opposed to e.g. the processors.
56 pio->sm[0].pinctrl =
57 (1 << PIO_SM0_PINCTRL_SET_COUNT_LSB) |
58 (0 << PIO_SM0_PINCTRL_SET_BASE_LSB);
59 gpio_set_function(0, pio_get_funcsel(pio));
```
###### The system can start and stop each state machine at any time, via the CTRL register. Multiple state machines can be

###### started simultaneously, and the deterministic nature of PIO means they can stay perfectly synchronised.

```

63 // Set the state machine running. The PIO CTRL register is global within a

67 hw_set_bits(&pio->ctrl, 1 << (PIO_CTRL_SM_ENABLE_LSB + 0));
```
###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 880

###### Most instructions are executed from instruction memory, but there are other sources which can be freely mixed:

- Instructions written to a special configuration register (SMx INSTR) are immediately executed, momentarily

###### interrupting other execution. For example, a JMP instruction written to SMx INSTR causes the state machine to start

###### executing from a different location.

- Instructions can be executed from a register, using the^ MOV EXEC^ instruction.
- Instructions can be executed from the output shifter, using the^ OUT EXEC^ instruction

###### The last of these is particularly versatile: instructions can be embedded in the stream of data passing through the FIFO.

###### The I2C example uses this to embed e.g. STOP and RESTART line conditions alongside normal data. In the case of MOV and

###### OUT EXEC, the MOV/OUT itself executes in one cycle, and the executee on the next.

#### 11.2.3. Registers

###### Each state machine possesses a small number of internal registers. These hold input or output data, and temporary

###### values such as loop counter variables.

##### 11.2.3.1. Output Shift Register (OSR)

Figure 46. Output Shift
Register (OSR). Data is
parcelled out 1...
bits at a time, and
unused data is
recycled by a
bidirectional shifter.
Once empty, the OSR
is reloaded from the
TX FIFO.

###### The Output Shift Register (OSR) holds and shifts output data between the TX FIFO and the pins or other destinations,

###### such as the scratch registers.

- PULL^ instructions: remove a 32-bit word from the TX FIFO and place into the OSR.
- OUT^ instructions shift data from the OSR to other destinations, 1...32 bits at a time.
- The OSR fills with zeroes as data is shifted out
- The state machine will automatically refill the OSR from the FIFO on an^ OUT^ instruction, once some total shift count

###### threshold is reached, if autopull is enabled

- Shift direction can be left/right, configurable by the processor via configuration registers

###### For example, to stream data through the FIFO and output to the pins at a rate of one byte per two clocks:

```
1 .program pull_example
2 loop:
3 out pins, 8
4 public entry_point:
5 pull
6 out pins, 8 [1]
7 out pins, 8 [1]
8 out pins, 8
9 jmp loop
```
#### 11.2.4. Autopull

###### Autopull (see Section 11.5.4) allows the hardware to automatically refill the OSR in the majority of cases, with the state

###### machine stalling if it tries to OUT from an empty OSR. This has two benefits:

###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 881

- No instructions spent on explicitly pulling from FIFO at the right time
- Higher throughput: can output up to 32 bits on every single clock cycle, if the FIFO stays topped up

###### After configuring autopull, the above program can be simplified to the following, which behaves identically:

```
1 .program pull_example
2
3 loop:
4 out pins, 8
5 public entry_point:
6 jmp loop
```
###### Program wrapping (Section 11.5.2) allows further simplification and, if desired, an output of 1 byte every system clock

###### cycle.

```
1 .program pull_example
2
3 public entry_point:
4 .wrap_target
5 out pins, 8 [1]
6 .wrap
```
##### 11.2.4.1. Input Shift Register (ISR)

Figure 47. Input Shift
Register (ISR). Data
enters 1...32 bits at a
time, and current
contents is shifted left
or right to make room.
Once full, contents is
written to the RX FIFO.

- IN^ instructions shift 1...32 bits at a time into the register.
- PUSH^ instructions write the ISR contents to the RX FIFO.
- The ISR is cleared to all-zeroes when pushed.
- The state machine will automatically push the ISR on an^ IN^ instruction, once some shift threshold is reached, if

###### autopush is enabled.

- Shift direction is configurable by the processor via configuration registers

###### Some peripherals, like UARTs, must shift in from the left to get correct bit order, since the wire order is LSB-first;

###### however, the processor may expect the resulting byte to be right-aligned. This is solved by the special null input source,

###### which allows the programmer to shift some number of zeroes into the ISR, following the data.

##### 11.2.4.2. Shift counters

###### State machines remember how many bits, in total, have been shifted out of the OSR via OUT instructions, and into the ISR

###### via IN instructions. This information is tracked at all times by a pair of hardware counters: the output shift counter and

###### the input shift counter. Each is capable of holding values from 0 to 32 inclusive. With each shift operation, the relevant

###### counter increments by the shift count, up to the maximum value of 32 (equal to the width of the shift register). The state

###### machine can be configured to perform certain actions when a counter reaches a configurable threshold:

- The OSR can be automatically refilled once some number of bits have been shifted out (see Section 11.5.4).
- The ISR can be automatically emptied once some number of bits have been shifted in (see Section 11.5.4.

###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 882

- PUSH^ or^ PULL^ instructions can be conditioned on the input or output shift counter, respectively.

###### On PIO reset, or the assertion of CTRL_SM_RESTART, the input shift counter is cleared to 0 (nothing yet shifted in), and the

###### output shift counter is initialised to 32 (nothing remaining to be shifted out; fully exhausted). Some other instructions

###### affect the shift counters:

- A successful^ PULL^ clears the output shift counter to 0
- A successful^ PUSH^ clears the input shift counter to 0
- MOV OSR, ...^ (i.e. any^ MOV^ instruction that writes^ OSR) clears the output shift counter to 0
- MOV ISR, ...^ (i.e. any^ MOV^ instruction that writes^ ISR) clears the input shift counter to 0
- OUT ISR, count^ sets the input shift counter to^ count

##### 11.2.4.3. Scratch registers

###### Each state machine has two 32-bit internal scratch registers, called X and Y.

###### They are used as:

- Source/destination for^ IN/OUT/SET/MOV
- Source for branch conditions

###### For example, suppose we wanted to produce a long pulse for "1" data bits, and a short pulse for "0" data bits:

```
1 .program ws2812_led
2
3 public entry_point:
4 pull
5 set x, 23 ; Loop over 24 bits
6 bitloop:
7 set pins, 1 ; Drive pin high
8 out y, 1 [5] ; Shift 1 bit out, and write it to y
9 jmp !y skip ; Skip the extra delay if the bit was 0
10 nop [5]
11 skip:
12 set pins, 0 [5]
13 jmp x-- bitloop ; Jump if x nonzero, and decrement x
14 jmp entry_point
```
###### Here X is used as a loop counter, and Y is used as a temporary variable for branching on single bits from the OSR. This

###### program can be used to drive a WS2812 LED interface, although more compact implementations are possible (as few

###### as 3 instructions).

###### MOV allows the use of the scratch registers to save/restore the shift registers if, for example, you would like to repeatedly

###### shift out the same sequence.

 (^) NOTE

###### A much more compact WS2812 example (4 instructions total) is shown in Section 11.6.2.

##### 11.2.4.4. FIFOs

###### Each state machine has a pair of 4-word deep FIFOs, one for data transfer from system to state machine (TX), and the

###### other for state machine to system (RX). The TX FIFO is written to by system bus masters, such as a processor or DMA

###### controller, and the RX FIFO is written to by the state machine. FIFOs decouple the timing of the PIO state machines and

###### the system bus, allowing state machines to go for longer periods without processor intervention.

###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 883

###### FIFOs also generate data request (DREQ) signals, which allow a system DMA controller to pace its reads/writes based

###### on the presence of data in an RX FIFO, or space for new data in a TX FIFO. This allows a processor to set up a long

###### transaction, potentially involving many kilobytes of data, which will proceed with no further processor intervention.

###### Often, a state machine only transfers data in one direction. In this case, the SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN option can merge the two

###### FIFOs into a single 8-entry FIFO that only goes in one direction. This is useful for high-bandwidth interfaces such as DPI.

#### 11.2.5. Stalling

###### State machines may momentarily pause execution for a number of reasons:

- A^ WAIT^ instruction’s condition is not yet met
- A blocking^ PULL^ when the TX FIFO is empty, or a blocking^ PUSH^ when the RX FIFO is full
- An^ IRQ WAIT^ instruction which has set an^ IRQ^ flag, and is waiting for it to clear
- An^ OUT^ instruction when autopull is enabled, and OSR has already reached its shift threshold
- An^ IN^ instruction when autopush is enabled, ISR reaches its shift threshold, and the RX FIFO is full

###### In this case, the program counter does not advance, and the state machine will continue executing this instruction on

###### the next cycle. If the instruction specifies some number of delay cycles before the next instruction starts, these do not

###### begin until after the stall clears.

#####  NOTE

###### Side-set (Section 11.5.1) is not affected by stalls, and always takes place on the first cycle of the attached

###### instruction.

#### 11.2.6. Pin mapping

###### PIO controls the output level and direction of up to 32 GPIOs, and can observe their input levels. On every system clock

###### cycle, each state machine may do none, one, or both of the following:

- Change the level or direction of some GPIOs via an^ OUT^ or^ SET^ instruction, or read some GPIOs via an^ IN^ instruction
- Change the level or direction of some GPIOs via a side-set operation

###### Each of these operations uses one of four contiguous ranges of GPIOs, with the base and count of each range

###### configured via each state machine’s PINCTRL register. There is a range for each of OUT, SET, IN and side-set operations.

###### Each range can cover any of the GPIOs accessible to a given PIO block (on RP2350 this is the 30 user GPIOs), and the

###### ranges can overlap.

###### For each individual GPIO output (level and direction separately), PIO considers all 8 writes that may have occurred on

###### that cycle, and applies the write from the highest-numbered state machine. If the same state machine performs a SET

###### /OUT and a side-set on the same GPIO simultaneously, the side-set is used. If no state machine writes to this GPIO

###### output, its value does not change from the previous cycle.

###### Generally each state machine’s outputs are mapped to a distinct group of GPIOs, implementing some peripheral

###### interface.

#### 11.2.7. IRQ flags

###### IRQ flags are state bits which can be set or cleared by state machines or the system. There are 8 in total: all 8 are visible

###### to all state machines, and the lower 4 can also be masked into one of PIO’s interrupt request lines, via the IRQ0_INTE and

###### IRQ1_INTE control registers.

###### They have two main uses:

###### 11.2. Programmer’s model 884

- Asserting system level interrupts from a state machine program, and optionally waiting for the interrupt to be

###### acknowledged

- Synchronising execution between two state machines

###### State machines interact with the flags via the IRQ and WAIT instructions.

#### 11.2.8. Interactions between state machines

###### Instruction memory is implemented as a 1-write, 4-read register file, allowing all four state machines to read an

###### instruction on the same cycle without stalling.

###### There are three ways to apply the multiple state machines:

- Pointing multiple state machines at the same program
- Pointing multiple state machines at different programs
- Using multiple state machines to run different parts of the same interface, e.g. TX and RX side of a UART, or

###### clock/hsync and pixel data on a DPI display

###### State machines cannot communicate data, but they can synchronise with one another by using the IRQ flags. There are

###### 8 flags total. Each state machine can set or clear any flag using the IRQ instruction, and can wait for a flag to go high or

###### low using the WAIT IRQ instruction. This allows cycle-accurate synchronisation between state machines.

## 11.3. PIO assembler (pioasm)

###### The PIO Assembler parses a PIO source file and outputs the assembled version ready for inclusion in an RP

###### application. This includes C and C++ applications built against the SDK, and Python programs running on the RP

###### MicroPython port.

###### This section briefly introduces the directives and instructions that can be used in pioasm input. For a deeper discussion

###### of how to use pioasm, how it is integrated into the SDK build system, extended features such as code pass through, and

###### the various output formats it can produce, see Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK.

#### 11.3.1. Directives

###### The following directives control the assembly of PIO programs:

.define (PUBLIC) <symbol> <value>

###### Define an integer symbol named <symbol> with the value <value> (see Section 11.3.2). If this .define appears before

###### the first program in the input file, then this define is global to all programs, otherwise it is local to the program in

###### which it occurs. If PUBLIC is specified, the symbol will be emitted into the assembled output for use by user code. For

###### the SDK this takes the following forms:

- #define <program_name> <symbol> value: for program symbols
- #define <symbol> value: for global symbols
.clock_div <divider>

###### If this directive is present, <divider> is the state machine clock divider for the program. Note, that divider is a floating

###### point value, but may not currently use arithmetic expressions or defined values. This directive affects the default

###### state machine configuration for a program. This directive is only valid within a program before the first instruction.

.fifo <fifo_config>

###### If this directive is present, it is used to specify the FIFO configuration for the program. It affects the default state

###### machine configuration for a program, but also restricts what instructions may be used (for example PUSH makes

###### 11.3. PIO assembler (pioasm) 885

###### no sense if there is no IN FIFO configured).

###### This directive supports the following configuration values:

- txrx: 4 FIFO entries for each of TX and RX; this is the default.
- tx: All 8 FIFO entries for TX.
- rx: All 8 FIFO entries for RX.
- txput: 4 FIFO entries for TX, and 4 FIFO entries for^ mov rxfifo[index], isr^ aka^ put. This value is not supported on

###### PIO version 0.

- txget: 4 FIFO entries for TX, and 4 FIFO entries for^ mov osr, rxfifo[index]^ aka^ get. This value is not supported on

###### PIO version 0.

- putget: 4 FIFO entries for^ mov rxfifo[index], isr^ aka^ put, and 4 FIFO entries for^ mov osr, rxfifo[index]^ aka^ get.

###### This value is not supported on PIO version 0.

#### 11.3.2. Values

###### The following types of values can be used to define integer numbers or branch targets:

Table 978. Values in

###### pioasm, i.e. <value> integer^ An integer value, e.g. 3 or -7.

###### hex A hexadecimal value, e.g. 0xf.

###### binary A binary value, e.g. 0b1001.

###### symbol A value defined by a .define (see pioasm_define).

###### <label> The instruction offset of the label within the program. Typically used with a JMP instruction

###### (see Section 11.4.2).

###### (<expression>) An expression to be evaluated; see expressions. Note that the parentheses are necessary.

#### 11.3.3. Expressions

###### Expressions may be freely used within pioasm values.

Table 979.
Expressions in pioasm
i.e. <expression>

###### <expression> + <expression> The sum of two expressions

###### <expression> - <expression> The difference of two expressions

###### <expression> * <expression> The multiplication of two expressions

###### <expression> / <expression> The integer division of two expressions

- <expression> The negation of another expression

###### 11.3. PIO assembler (pioasm) 887

<expression> << <expression> (^) One expression shifted left by another expression

###### <expression> >> <expression> One expression shifted right by another expression

###### :: <expression> The bit reverse of another expression

###### <value> Any value (see Section 11.3.2)

#### 11.3.4. Comments

###### To create a line comment that ignores all content on a certain line following a certain symbol, use // or ;.

###### To create a C-style block comment that ignores all content across multiple lines until after a start symbol until an end

###### symbol appears, use /* to begin the comment and */ to end the comment.

#### 11.3.5. Labels

###### Labels use the following forms at the start of a line:

```
<symbol>:
PUBLIC <symbol>:
```
#####  TIP

###### A label is really just an automatic .define with a value set to the current program instruction offset. A PUBLIC label is

###### exposed to the user code in the same way as a PUBLIC .define.

#### 11.3.6. Instructions

###### All pioasm instructions follow a common pattern:

<instruction> (side <side_set_value>) ([<delay_value>])

###### where:

###### <instruction> An assembly instruction detailed in the following sections. (see Section 11.4)

###### <side_set_value> A value (see Section 11.3.2) to apply to the side_set pins at the start of the instruction. Note that

###### the rules for a side-set value via side <side_set_value> are dependent on the .side_set (see

###### pioasm_side_set) directive for the program. If no .side_set is specified then the side <side_set_value>

###### is invalid, if an optional number of sideset pins is specified then side <side_set_value> may be

###### present, and if a non-optional number of sideset pins is specified, then side <side_set_value> is

###### required. The <side_set_value> must fit within the number of side-set bits specified in the .side_set

###### directive.

###### 11.3. PIO assembler (pioasm) 888

<delay_value> (^) Specifies the number of cycles to delay after the instruction completes. The delay_value is

###### specified as a value (see Section 11.3.2), and in general is between 0 and 31 inclusive (a 5-bit

###### value), however the number of bits is reduced when sideset is enabled via the .side_set (see

###### pioasm_side_set) directive. If the <delay_value> is not present, then the instruction has no delay.

#####  NOTE

###### pioasm instruction names, keywords and directives are case insensitive; lower case is used in the Assembly Syntax

###### sections below, as this is the style used in the SDK.

#####  NOTE

###### Commas appear in some Assembly Syntax sections below, but are entirely optional, e.g. out pins, 3 may be written

###### out pins 3 , and jmp x-- label may be written as jmp x--, label. The Assembly Syntax sections below uses the first

###### style in each case as this is the style used in the SDK.

#### 11.3.7. Pseudo-instructions

###### pioasm provides aliases for certain instructions, as a convenience:

###### nop Assembles to mov y, y. No side effect, but a useful vehicle for a side-set operation or an extra delay.

## 11.4. Instruction Set

###### SET 1 1 1 Delay/side-set Destination Data

###### All PIO instructions execute in one clock cycle.

###### The function of the 5-bit Delay/side-set field depends on the state machine’s SIDESET_COUNT configuration:

- Up to 5 LSBs (5 minus^ SIDESET_COUNT) encode a number of idle cycles inserted between this instruction and the next.

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 889

- Up to 5 MSBs, set by^ SIDESET_COUNT, encode a side-set (Section 11.5.1), which can assert a constant onto some

###### GPIOs, concurrently with main instruction execution.

Bit 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

###### JMP 0 0 0 Delay/side-set Condition Address

##### 11.4.2.2. Operation

###### Set program counter to Address if Condition is true, otherwise no operation.

###### Delay cycles on a JMP always take effect, whether Condition is true or false, and they take place after Condition is

###### evaluated and the program counter is updated.

- Condition:

### ◦ 000:^ (no condition): Always

### ◦ 001:^ !X: scratch X zero

### ◦ 010:^ X--: scratch X non-zero, prior to decrement

### ◦ 011:^ !Y: scratch Y zero

### ◦ 100:^ Y--: scratch Y non-zero, prior to decrement

### ◦ 101:^ X!=Y: scratch X not equal scratch Y

### ◦ 110:^ PIN: branch on input pin

### ◦ 111:^ !OSRE: output shift register not empty

- Address: Instruction address to jump to. In the instruction encoding this is an absolute address within the PIO

###### instruction memory

###### JMP PIN branches on the GPIO selected by EXECCTRL_JMP_PIN, a configuration field which selects one out of the maximum

###### of 32 GPIO inputs visible to a state machine, independently of the state machine’s other input mapping. The branch is

###### taken if the GPIO is high.

###### !OSRE compares the bits shifted out since the last PULL with the shift count threshold configured by SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH.

###### This is the same threshold used by autopull (Section 11.5.4).

###### JMP X-- and JMP Y-- always decrement scratch register X or Y, respectively. The decrement is not conditional on the

###### current value of the scratch register. The branch is conditioned on the initial value of the register, i.e. before the

###### decrement took place: if the register is initially nonzero, the branch is taken.

##### 11.4.2.3. Assembler syntax

jmp (<cond>) <target>

###### where:

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 890

<cond> (^) An optional condition listed above (e.g. !x for scratch X zero). If a condition code is not specified, the

###### branch is always taken.

###### <target> A program label or value (see Section 11.3.2) representing instruction offset within the program (the

###### first instruction being offset 0). Because the PIO JMP instruction uses absolute addresses in the PIO

###### instruction memory, JMPs need to be adjusted based on the program load offset at runtime. This is

###### handled for you when loading a program with the SDK, but care should be taken when encoding JMP

###### instructions for use by OUT EXEC.

#### 11.4.3. WAIT

##### 11.4.3.1. Encoding

Bit 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

###### WAIT 0 0 1 Delay/side-set Pol Source Index

##### 11.4.3.2. Operation

###### Stall until some condition is met.

###### Like all stalling instructions (Section 11.2.5), delay cycles begin after the instruction completes. That is, if any delay

###### cycles are present, they do not begin counting until after the wait condition is met.

- Polarity:

### ◦ 1: wait for a 1.

### ◦ 0: wait for a 0.

- Source: what to wait on. Values are:

### ◦ 00:^ GPIO: System GPIO input selected by^ Index. This is an absolute GPIO index, and is not affected by the state

###### machine’s input IO mapping.

### ◦ 01:^ PIN: Input pin selected by^ Index. This state machine’s input IO mapping is applied first, and then^ Index

###### selects which of the mapped bits to wait on. In other words, the pin is selected by adding Index to the

###### PINCTRL_IN_BASE configuration, modulo 32.

### ◦ 10:^ IRQ: PIO IRQ flag selected by^ Index

### ◦ 11:^ JMPPIN: wait on the pin indexed by the^ PINCTRL_JMP_PIN^ configuration, plus an Index in the range 0-3, all

###### modulo 32. Other values of Index are reserved.

- Index: which pin or bit to check.

###### WAIT x IRQ behaves slightly differently from other WAIT sources:

- If^ Polarity^ is 1, the selected IRQ flag is cleared by the state machine upon the wait condition being met.
- The flag index is decoded in the same way as the^ IRQ^ index field, decoding down from the two MSBs (aligning with

###### the IRQ instruction IdxMode field):

### ◦ 00 : the three LSBs are used directly to index the IRQ flags in this PIO block.

### ◦ 01 (PREV), the instruction references an IRQ from the next-lower-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to the

###### highest-numbered PIO if this is PIO0.

### ◦ 10 (REL), the state machine ID (0...3) is added to the IRQ index, by way of modulo-4 addition on the two LSBs.

###### For example, state machine 2 with a flag value of 0x11 will wait on flag 3, and a flag value of 0x13 will wait on

###### flag 1. This allows multiple state machines running the same program to synchronise with each other.

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 891

### ◦ 11 (NEXT), the instruction references an IRQ from the next-higher-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to

###### PIO0 if this is the highest-numbered PIO.

#####  CAUTION

###### WAIT 1 IRQ x should not be used with IRQ flags presented to the interrupt controller, to avoid a race condition with a

###### system interrupt handler

##### 11.4.3.3. Assembler syntax

```
wait <polarity> gpio <gpio_num>
wait <polarity> pin <pin_num>
wait <polarity> irq (prev | next) <irq_num> (rel)
wait <polarity> jmppin (+ <pin_offset>)
```
###### where:

###### <polarity> A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the polarity (either 0 or 1).

###### <pin_num> A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the input pin number (as mapped by the SM input pin

###### mapping).

###### <gpio_num> A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the actual GPIO pin number.

###### <irq_num> (rel) A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying The IRQ number to wait on (0-7). If rel is present, then the

###### actual IRQ number used is calculating by replacing the low two bits of the IRQ number (irq_num 10 )

###### with the low two bits of the sum (irq_num 10 + sm_num 10 ) where sm_num 10 is the state machine number.

###### prev To wait on the IRQ on the next lower numbered PIO block instead of on the current PIO block

###### next To wait on the IRQ on the next higher numbered PIO block instead of on the current PIO block

###### <pin_offset> A value (see Section 11.3.2) added to the jmp_pin to get the actual pin number.

#### 11.4.4. IN

IN (^0 1 0) Delay/side-set Source Bit count

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 892

##### 11.4.4.2. Operation

###### Shift Bit count bits from Source into the Input Shift Register (ISR). Shift direction is configured for each state machine by

###### SHIFTCTRL_IN_SHIFTDIR. Additionally, increase the input shift count by Bit count, saturating at 32.

- Source:

### ◦ 000:^ PINS

### ◦ 001:^ X^ (scratch register X)

### ◦ 010:^ Y^ (scratch register Y)

### ◦ 011:^ NULL^ (all zeroes)

### ◦ 100: Reserved

### ◦ 101: Reserved

### ◦ 110:^ ISR

### ◦ 111:^ OSR

- Bit count: How many bits to shift into the ISR. 1...32 bits, 32 is encoded as^00000

###### If automatic push is enabled, IN will also push the ISR contents to the RX FIFO if the push threshold is reached

###### (SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH). IN still executes in one cycle, whether an automatic push takes place or not. The state machine

###### will stall if the RX FIFO is full when an automatic push occurs. An automatic push clears the ISR contents to all-zeroes,

###### and clears the input shift count. See Section 11.5.4.

###### IN always uses the least significant Bit count bits of the source data. For example, if PINCTRL_IN_BASE is set to 5, the

###### instruction IN PINS, 3 will take the values of pins 5, 6 and 7, and shift these into the ISR. First the ISR is shifted to the left

###### or right to make room for the new input data, then the input data is copied into the gap this leaves. The bit order of the

###### input data is not dependent on the shift direction.

###### NULL can be used for shifting the ISR’s contents. For example, UARTs receive the LSB first, so must shift to the right.

###### After 8 IN PINS, 1 instructions, the input serial data will occupy bits 31...24 of the ISR. An IN NULL, 24 instruction will shift

###### in 24 zero bits, aligning the input data at ISR bits 7...0. Alternatively, the processor or DMA could perform a byte read

###### from FIFO address + 3, which would take bits 31...24 of the FIFO contents.

##### 11.4.4.3. Assembler syntax

in <source>, <bit_count>

###### where:

###### <source> One of the sources specified above.

###### <bit_count> A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the number of bits to shift (valid range 1-32).

#### 11.4.5. OUT

##### 11.4.5.1. Encoding

Bit 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

###### OUT 0 1 1 Delay/side-set Destination Bit count

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 893

##### 11.4.5.2. Operation

###### Shift Bit count bits out of the Output Shift Register (OSR), and write those bits to Destination. Additionally, increase the

###### output shift count by Bit count, saturating at 32.

- Destination:

### ◦ 000:^ PINS

### ◦ 001:^ X^ (scratch register X)

### ◦ 010:^ Y^ (scratch register Y)

### ◦ 011:^ NULL^ (discard data)

### ◦ 100:^ PINDIRS

### ◦ 101:^ PC

### ◦ 110:^ ISR^ (also sets ISR shift counter to^ Bit count)

### ◦ 111:^ EXEC^ (Execute OSR shift data as instruction)

- Bit count: how many bits to shift out of the OSR. 1...32 bits, 32 is encoded as^00000

###### A 32-bit value is written to Destination: the lower Bit count bits come from the OSR, and the remainder are zeroes. This

###### value is the least significant Bit count bits of the OSR if SHIFTCTRL_OUT_SHIFTDIR is to the right, otherwise it is the most

###### significant bits.

###### PINS and PINDIRS use the OUT pin mapping, as described in Section 11.5.6.

###### If automatic pull is enabled, the OSR is automatically refilled from the TX FIFO if the pull threshold, SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH,

###### is reached. The output shift count is simultaneously cleared to 0. In this case, the OUT will stall if the TX FIFO is empty,

###### but otherwise still executes in one cycle. The specifics are given in Section 11.5.4.

###### OUT EXEC allows instructions to be included inline in the FIFO datastream. The OUT itself executes on one cycle, and the

###### instruction from the OSR is executed on the next cycle. There are no restrictions on the types of instructions which can

###### be executed by this mechanism. Delay cycles on the initial OUT are ignored, but the executee may insert delay cycles as

###### normal.

###### OUT PC behaves as an unconditional jump to an address shifted out from the OSR.

##### 11.4.5.3. Assembler syntax

out <destination>, <bit_count>

###### PUSH 1 0 0 Delay/side-set 0 IfF Blk 0 0 0 0 0

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 894

##### 11.4.6.2. Operation

###### Push the contents of the ISR into the RX FIFO, as a single 32-bit word. Clear ISR to all-zeroes.

- IfFull: If 1, do nothing unless the total input shift count has reached its threshold,^ SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH^ (the same

###### as for autopush; see Section 11.5.4).

- Block: If 1, stall execution if RX FIFO is full.

###### PUSH IFFULL helps to make programs more compact, like autopush. It is useful in cases where the IN would stall at an

###### inappropriate time if autopush were enabled, e.g. if the state machine is asserting some external control signal at this

###### point.

###### The PIO assembler sets the Block bit by default. If the Block bit is not set, the PUSH does not stall on a full RX FIFO, instead

###### continuing immediately to the next instruction. The FIFO state and contents are unchanged when this happens. The ISR

###### is still cleared to all-zeroes, and the FDEBUG_RXSTALL flag is set (the same as a blocking PUSH or autopush to a full RX FIFO)

###### to indicate data was lost.

#####  NOTE

###### The operation of the PUSH instruction is undefined when SM0_SHIFTCTRL.FJOIN_RX_PUT or FJOIN_RX_GET is

###### set — see Section 11.4.8 and Section 11.4.9 for details of the PUT and GET instruction which can be used in this state.

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 895

##### 11.4.7.2. Operation

###### Load a 32-bit word from the TX FIFO into the OSR.

- IfEmpty: If 1, do nothing unless the total output shift count has reached its threshold,^ SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH^ (the

###### same as for autopull; see Section 11.5.4).

- Block: If 1, stall if TX FIFO is empty. If 0, pulling from an empty FIFO copies scratch X to OSR.

###### Some peripherals (UART, SPI, etc.) should halt when no data is available, and pick it up as it comes in; others (I2S)

###### should clock continuously, and it is better to output placeholder or repeated data than to stop clocking. This can be

###### achieved with the Block parameter.

###### A non-blocking PULL on an empty FIFO has the same effect as MOV OSR, X. The program can either preload scratch

###### register X with a suitable default, or execute a MOV X, OSR after each PULL NOBLOCK, so that the last valid FIFO word will be

###### recycled until new data is available.

###### PULL IFEMPTY is useful if an OUT with autopull would stall in an inappropriate location when the TX FIFO is empty. IfEmpty

###### permits some of the same program simplifications as autopull: for example, the elimination of an outer loop counter.

###### However, the stall occurs at a controlled point in the program.

 (^) NOTE

###### When autopull is enabled, any PULL instruction is a no-op when the OSR is full, so that the PULL instruction behaves as

###### a barrier. OUT NULL, 32 can be used to explicitly discard the OSR contents. See Section 11.5.4.2 for more detail.

###### 11.4. Instruction Set 896

##### 11.4.8.2. Operation

###### Write the ISR to a selected RX FIFO entry. The state machine can write the RX FIFO entries in any order, indexed either

###### by the Y register, or an immediate Index in the instruction. Requires the SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT configuration field to be

###### set, otherwise its operation is undefined. The FIFO configuration can be specified for the program via the .fifo directive

###### (see pioasm_fifo).

###### If IdxI (index by immediate) is set, the RX FIFO’s registers are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Index

###### operand. Otherwise, they are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Y register. When IdxI is clear, all non-zero

###### values of Index are reserved encodings, and their operation is undefined.

###### When only SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT is set (in SM0_SHIFTCTRL through SM3_SHIFTCTRL), the system can also read the RX

###### FIFO registers with random access via RXF0_PUTGET0 through RXF0_PUTGET3 (where RXFx indicates which state

###### machine’s FIFO is being accessed). In this state, the FIFO register storage is repurposed as status registers, which the

###### state machine can update at any time and the system can read at any time. For example, a quadrature decoder program

###### could maintain the current step count in a status register at all times, rather than pushing to the RX FIFO and potentially

###### blocking.

###### When both SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT and SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET are set, the system can no longer access the RX FIFO

###### storage registers, but the state machine can now put/get the registers in arbitrary order, allowing them to be used as

###### additional scratch storage.

###### operand. Otherwise, they are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Y register. When IdxI is clear, all non-zero

###### values of Index are reserved encodings, and their operation is undefined.

###### When only SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET is set, the system can also write the RX FIFO registers with random access via

###### RXF0_PUTGET0 through RXF0_PUTGET3 (where RXFx indicates which state machine’s FIFO is being accessed). In this

###### state, the RX FIFO register storage is repurposed as additional configuration registers, which the system can update at

###### any time and the state machine can read at any time. For example, a UART TX program might use these registers to

###### configure the number of data bits, or the presence of an additional stop bit.

###### When both SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT and SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET are set, the system can no longer access the RX FIFO

### ◦ 10 (REL): the state machine ID (0...3) is added to the IRQ flag index, by way of modulo-4 addition on the two

###### LSBs. For example, state machine 2 with a flag value of '0x11' will wait on flag 3, and a flag value of '0x13' will

###### wait on flag 1. This allows multiple state machines running the same program to synchronise with each other.

### ◦ 11 (NEXT): the instruction references an IRQ flag from the next-higher-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to

###### PIO0 if this is the highest-numbered PIO.

###### All IRQ flags 0-7 can be routed out to system level interrupts, on either of the PIO’s two external interrupt request lines,

## 11.5. Functional details

#### 11.5.1. Side-set

###### Side-set is a feature that allows state machines to change the level or direction of up to 5 pins, concurrently with the

###### main execution of the instruction.

###### One example where this is necessary is a fast SPI interface: here a clock transition (toggling 1→0 or 0→1) must be

###### simultaneous with a data transition, where a new data bit is shifted from the OSR to a GPIO. In this case an OUT with a

###### side-set would achieve both of these at once.

###### This makes the timing of the interface more precise, reduces the overall program size (as a separate SET instruction is

###### not needed to toggle the clock pin), and also increases the maximum frequency the SPI can run at.

###### Side-set also makes GPIO mapping much more flexible, as its mapping is independent from SET. The example I2C code

###### allows SDA and SCL to be mapped to any two arbitrary pins, if clock stretching is disabled. Normally, SCL toggles to

###### synchronise data transfer, and SDA contains the data bits being shifted out. However, some particular I2C sequences

###### such as Start and Stop line conditions, need a fixed pattern to be driven on SDA as well as SCL. The mapping I2C uses to

###### achieve this is:

- Side-set^ →^ SCL

###### 11.5. Functional details 902

- OUT^ →^ SDA
- SET^ →^ SDA

###### This lets the state machine serve the two use cases of data on SDA and clock on SCL, or fixed transitions on both SDA

###### and SCL, while still allowing SDA and SCL to be mapped to any two GPIOs of choice.

###### The side-set data is encoded in the Delay/side-set field of each instruction. Any instruction can be combined with side-

###### set, including instructions which write to the pins, such as OUT PINS or SET PINS. Side-set’s pin mapping is independent

###### from OUT and SET mappings, though it may overlap. If side-set and an OUT or SET write to the same pin simultaneously, the

###### side-set data is used.

#####  NOTE

###### If an instruction stalls, the side-set still takes effect immediately.

```
1 .program spi_tx_fast
2 .side_set 1
3
4 loop:
5 out pins, 1 side 0
6 jmp loop side 1
```
###### The spi_tx_fast example shows two benefits of this: data and clock transitions can be more precisely co-aligned, and

###### programs can be made faster overall, with an output of one bit per two system clock cycles in this case. Programs can

###### also be made smaller.

###### There are four things to configure when using side-set:

- The number of MSBs of the^ Delay/side-set^ field to use for side-set rather than delay. This is configured by

###### PINCTRL_SIDESET_COUNT. If this is set to 5, delay cycles are not available. If set to 0, no side-set will take place.

- Whether to use the most significant of these bits as an enable. Side-set takes place on instructions where the

###### enable is high. If there is no enable bit, every instruction on that state machine will perform a side-set, if

###### SIDESET_COUNT is nonzero. This is configured by EXECCTRL_SIDE_EN.

- The GPIO number to map the least-significant side-set bit to. Configured by^ PINCTRL_SIDESET_BASE.
- Whether side-set writes to GPIO levels or GPIO directions. Configured by^ EXECCTRL_SIDE_PINDIR

###### In the above example, we have only one side-set data bit, and every instruction performs a side-set, so no enable bit is

###### required. SIDESET_COUNT would be 1, SIDE_EN would be false. SIDE_PINDIR would also be false, as we want to drive the clock

###### high and low, not high- and low-impedance. SIDESET_BASE would select the GPIO the clock is driven from.

#### 11.5.2. Program wrapping

###### PIO programs often have an "outer loop": they perform the same sequence of steps, repetitively, as they transfer a

###### stream of data between the FIFOs and the outside world. The square wave program from the introduction is a minimal

###### example of this:

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.pio Lines 8 - 13
8 .program squarewave
9 set pindirs, 1 ; Set pin to output
10 again:
11 set pins, 1 [1] ; Drive pin high and then delay for one cycle
12 set pins, 0 ; Drive pin low
13 jmp again ; Set PC to label `again`
```
###### 11.5. Functional details 903

###### The main body of the program drives a pin high, and then low, producing one period of a square wave. The entire

###### program then loops, driving a periodic output. The jump itself takes one cycle, as does each set instruction, so to keep

###### the high and low periods of the same duration, the set pins, 1 has a single delay cycle added, which makes the state

###### machine idle for one cycle before executing the set pins, 0 instruction. In total, each loop takes four cycles. There are

###### two frustrations here:

- The^ JMP^ takes up space in the instruction memory that could be used for other programs
- The extra cycle taken to execute the^ JMP^ ends up^ halving^ the maximum output rate

###### As the Program Counter (PC) naturally wraps to 0 when incremented past 31, we could solve the second of these by

###### filling the entire instruction memory with a repeating pattern of set pins, 1 and set pins, 0, but this is wasteful. State

###### machines have a hardware feature, configured via their EXECCTRL control register, which solves this common case.

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave_wrap.pio Lines 12 - 20
12 .program squarewave_wrap
13 ; Like squarewave, but use the state machine's .wrap hardware instead of an
14 ; explicit jmp. This is a free (0-cycle) unconditional jump.

17 .wrap_target
18 set pins, 1 [1] ; Drive pin high and then delay for one cycle
19 set pins, 0 [1] ; Drive pin low and then delay for one cycle
20 .wrap
```
###### After executing an instruction from the program memory, state machines use the following logic to update PC:

###### 1. If the current instruction is a JMP, and the Condition is true, set PC to the Target

###### 2. Otherwise, if PC matches EXECCTRL_WRAP_TOP, set PC to EXECCTRL_WRAP_BOTTOM

###### 3. Otherwise, increment PC, or set to 0 if the current value is 31.

###### The .wrap_target and .wrap assembly directives in pioasm are essentially labels. They export constants which can be

###### written to the WRAP_BOTTOM and WRAP_TOP control fields, respectively:

#### 11.5.3. FIFO joining

###### By default, each state machine possesses a 4-entry FIFO in each direction: one for data transfer from system to state

###### machine (TX), the other for the reverse direction (RX). However, many applications do not require bidirectional data

###### transfer between the system and an individual state machine, but may benefit from deeper FIFOs: in particular, high-

###### bandwidth interfaces such as DPI. For these cases, SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN can merge the two 4-entry FIFOs into a single 8-entry

###### FIFO.

###### 11.5. Functional details 905

Figure 48. Joinable
dual FIFO. A pair of
four-entry FIFOs,
implemented with four
data registers, a 1:4
decoder and a 4:1
multiplexer. Additional
multiplexing allows
write data and read
data to cross between
the TX and RX lanes,
so that all 8 entries
are accessible from
both ports

###### Another example is a UART: because the TX/CTS and RX/RTS parts a of a UART are asynchronous, they are

###### implemented on two separate state machines. It would be wasteful to leave half of each state machine’s FIFO

###### resources idle. The ability to join the two halves into just a TX FIFO for the TX/CTS state machine, or just an RX FIFO in

###### the case of the RX/RTS state machine, allows full utilisation. A UART equipped with an 8-deep FIFO can be left alone for

###### twice as long between interrupts as one with only a 4-deep FIFO.

###### When one FIFO is increased in size (from 4 to 8), the other FIFO on that state machine is reduced to zero. For example, if

###### joining to TX, the RX FIFO is unavailable, and any PUSH instruction will stall. The RX FIFO will appear both RXFULL and

###### RXEMPTY in the FSTAT register. The converse is true if joining to RX: the TX FIFO is unavailable, and the TXFULL and TXEMPTY

###### bits for this state machine will both be set in FSTAT. Setting both FJOIN_RX and FJOIN_TX makes both FIFOs unavailable.

###### 8 FIFO entries is sufficient for 1 word per clock through the RP2350 system DMA, provided the DMA is not slowed by

###### contention with other masters.

#####  CAUTION

###### Changing FJOIN discards any data present in the state machine’s FIFOs. If this data is irreplaceable, it must be

###### drained beforehand.

#### 11.5.4. Autopush and Autopull

###### With each OUT instruction, the OSR gradually empties, as data is shifted out. Once empty, it must be refilled: for example,

###### a PULL transfers one word of data from the TX FIFO to the OSR. Similarly, the ISR must be emptied once full. One

###### approach to this is a loop which performs a PULL after an appropriate amount of data has been shifted:

```
1 .program manual_pull
2 .side_set 1 opt
3
4 .wrap_target
5 set x, 2 ; X = bit count - 2
6 pull side 1 [1] ; Stall here if no TX data
7 bitloop:
8 out pins, 1 side 0 [1] ; Shift out data bit and toggle clock low
9 jmp x-- bitloop side 1 [1] ; Loop runs 3 times
10 out pins, 1 side 0 ; Shift out last bit before reloading X
11 .wrap
```
###### This program shifts out 4 bits from each FIFO word, with an accompanying bit clock, at a constant rate of 1 bit per 4

###### cycles. When the TX FIFO is empty, it stalls with the clock high (noting that side-set still takes place on cycles where the

###### 11.5. Functional details 906

###### instruction stalls). Figure 49 shows how a state machine would execute this program.

program. X is used as
a loop counter. On
each iteration, one
data bit is shifted out,
and the clock is
asserted low, then
high. A delay cycle on
each instruction
brings the total up to
four cycles per
iteration. After the
third loop, a fourth bit
is shifted out, and the
state machine
immediately returns to
the start of the
program to reload the
loop counter and pull
fresh data, while
maintaining the 4
cycles/bit cadence.

###### This program has some limitations:

- It occupies 5 instruction slots, but only 2 of these are immediately useful (out pins, 1 set 0 and ... set 1), for

###### outputting serial data and a clock.

- Throughput is limited to system clock over 4, due to the extra cycles required to pull in new data, and reload the

###### loop counter.

###### This is a common type of problem for PIO, so each state machine has some extra hardware to handle it. State machines

###### keep track of the total shift count OUT of the OSR and IN to the ISR, and trigger certain actions once these counters reach

###### a programmable threshold.

- On an^ OUT^ instruction which reaches or exceeds the pull threshold, the state machine can simultaneously refill the

###### OSR from the TX FIFO, if data is available.

- On an^ IN^ instruction which reaches or exceeds the push threshold, the state machine can write the shift result

###### directly to the RX FIFO, and clear the ISR.

###### The manual_pull example can be rewritten to take advantage of automatic pull (autopull):

```
1 .program autopull
2 .side_set 1
3
4 .wrap_target
5 out pins, 1 side 0 [1]
6 nop side 1 [1]
7 .wrap
```
###### This is shorter and simpler than the original, and can run twice as fast, if the delay cycles are removed, since the

###### hardware refills the OSR "for free". Note that the program does not determine the total number of bits to be shifted

###### before the next pull; the hardware automatically pulls once the programmable threshold, SHIFCTRL_PULL_THRESH, is reached,

###### so the same program could also shift out e.g. 16 or 32 bits from each FIFO word.

###### Finally, note that the above program is not exactly the same as the original, since it stalls with the clock output low,

###### rather than high. We can change the location of the stall, using the PULL IFEMPTY instruction, which uses the same

###### configurable threshold as autopull:

```
1 .program somewhat_manual_pull
2 .side_set 1
3
4 .wrap_target
5 out pins, 1 side 0 [1]
6 pull ifempty side 1 [1]
7 .wrap
```
###### Below is a complete example (PIO program, plus a C program to load and run it) which illustrates autopull and autopush

###### both enabled on the same state machine. It programs state machine 0 to loopback data from the TX FIFO to the RX

###### FIFO, with a throughput of one word per two clocks. It also demonstrates how the state machine will stall if it tries to OUT

###### when both the OSR and TX FIFO are empty.

###### Figure 50 shows how the state machine executes the example program. Initially the OSR is empty, so the state machine

###### stalls on the first OUT instruction. Once data is available in the TX FIFO, the state machine transfers this into the OSR. On

###### the next cycle, the OUT can execute using the data in the OSR (in this case, transferring this data to the X scratch

###### register), and the state machine simultaneously refills the OSR with fresh data from the FIFO. Since every IN instruction

###### immediately fills the ISR, the ISR remains empty, and IN transfers data directly from scratch X to the RX FIFO.

Figure 50. Execution

program. The state
machine stalls on an
OUT until data has
travelled through the
TX FIFO into the OSR.
Subsequently, the OSR
is refilled
simultaneously with
each OUT operation
(due to bit count of
32), and IN data
bypasses the ISR and
goes straight to the RX
FIFO. The state
machine stalls again
when the FIFO has
drained, and the OSR
is once again empty.

###### To trigger automatic push or pull at the correct time, the state machine tracks the total shift count of the ISR and OSR,

###### using a pair of saturating 6-bit counters.

- At reset, or upon^ CTRL_SM_RESTART^ assertion, ISR shift counter is set to 0 (nothing shifted in), and OSR to 32 (nothing

###### left to be shifted out)

- An^ OUT^ instruction increases the OSR shift counter by^ Bit count
- An^ IN^ instruction increases the ISR shift counter by^ Bit count
- A^ PULL^ instruction or autopull clears the OSR counter to 0
- A^ PUSH^ instruction or autopush clears the ISR counter to 0
- A^ MOV OSR, x^ or^ MOV ISR, x^ clears the OSR or ISR shift counter to 0, respectively
- A^ OUT ISR, n^ instruction sets the ISR shift counter to^ n

###### On any OUT or IN instruction, the state machine compares the shift counters to the values of SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH and

###### SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH to decide whether action is required. Autopull and autopush are individually enabled by the

###### SHIFTCTRL_AUTOPULL and SHIFTCTRL_AUTOPUSH fields.

##### 11.5.4.1. Autopush details

###### Pseudocode for an IN with autopush enabled:

```
1 isr = shift_in(isr, input())
2 isr count = saturate(isr count + in count)
3
4 if rx count >= threshold:
5 if rx fifo is full:
6 stall
7 else:
8 push(isr)
9 isr = 0
10 isr count = 0
```
###### The hardware performs the above steps in a single machine clock cycle, unless there is a stall.

###### Threshold is configurable from 1 to 32.

###### 11.5. Functional details 909

#####  IMPORTANT

###### Autopush must not be enabled when SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT or SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET is set. Its operation in this state

###### is undefined.

##### 11.5.4.2. Autopull Details

###### On non-OUT cycles, the hardware performs the equivalent of the following pseudocode:

```
1 if MOV or PULL:
2 osr count = 0
3
4 if osr count >= threshold:
5 if tx fifo not empty:
6 osr = pull()
7 osr count = 0
```
###### An autopull can therefore occur at any point between two OUTs, depending on when the data arrives in the FIFO.

###### On OUT cycles, the sequence is a little different:

```
1 if osr count >= threshold:
2 if tx fifo not empty:
3 osr = pull()
4 osr count = 0
5 stall
6 else:
7 output(osr)
8 osr = shift(osr, out count)
9 osr count = saturate(osr count + out count)
10
11 if osr count >= threshold:
12 if tx fifo not empty:
13 osr = pull()
14 osr count = 0
```
###### The hardware is capable of refilling the OSR simultaneously with shifting out the last of the shift data, as these two

###### operations can proceed in parallel. However, it cannot fill an empty OSR and OUT it on the same cycle, due to the long

###### logic path this would create.

###### The refill is somewhat asynchronous to your program, but an OUT behaves as a data fence, and the state machine will

###### never OUT data which you didn’t write into the FIFO.

###### Note that a MOV from the OSR is undefined whilst autopull is enabled; you will read either any residual data that has not

###### been shifted out, or a fresh word from the FIFO, depending on a race against system DMA. Likewise, a MOV to the OSR

###### may overwrite data which has just been autopulled. However, data which you MOV into the OSR will never be overwritten,

###### since MOV updates the shift counter.

###### If you do need to read the OSR contents, you should perform an explicit PULL of some kind. The nondeterminism

###### described above is the cost of the hardware managing pulls automatically. When autopull is enabled, the behaviour of

###### PULL is altered: it becomes a no-op if the OSR is full. This is to avoid a race condition against the system DMA. It behaves

###### as a fence: either an autopull has already taken place, in which case the PULL has no effect, or the program will stall on

###### the PULL until data becomes available in the FIFO.

###### PULL does not require similar behaviour, because autopush does not have the same nondeterminism.

###### 11.5. Functional details 910

#### 11.5.5. Clock Dividers

###### PIO runs off the system clock, but this is too fast for many interfaces, and the number of Delay cycles which can be

###### inserted is limited. Some devices, such as UART, require the signalling rate to be precisely controlled and varied, and

###### ideally multiple state machines can be varied independently while running identical programs. Each state machine is

###### equipped with a clock divider, for this purpose.

###### Rather than slowing the system clock itself, the clock divider redefines how many system clock periods are considered

###### to be "one cycle", for execution purposes. It does this by generating a clock enable signal, which can pause and resume

###### execution on a per-system-clock-cycle basis. The clock divider generates clock enable pulses at regular intervals, so

###### that the state machine runs at some steady pace, potentially much slower than the system clock.

###### Implementing the clock dividers in this way allows interfacing between the state machines and the system to be

###### simpler, lower-latency, and with a smaller footprint. The state machine is completely idle on cycles where clock enable

###### is low, though the system can still access the state machine’s FIFOs and change its configuration.

###### The clock dividers are 16-bit integer, 8-bit fractional, with first-order delta-sigma for the fractional divider. The clock

###### divisor can vary between 1 and 65536, in increments of.

###### If the clock divisor is set to 1, the state machine runs on every cycle, i.e. full speed:

increased by one for

period.

###### For small n, the jitter introduced by a fractional divider may be unacceptable. However, for larger values, this effect is

###### much less apparent.

#####  NOTE

###### For fast asynchronous serial, it is recommended to use even divisions or multiples of 1 Mbaud where possible,

###### rather than the traditional multiples of 300, to avoid unnecessary jitter.

#### 11.5.6. GPIO mapping

###### Internally, PIO has a 32-bit register for the output levels of each GPIO it can drive, and another register for the output

###### enables (Hi/Lo-Z). On every system clock cycle, each state machine can write to some or all of the GPIOs in each of

###### these registers.

###### 11.5. Functional details 911

Figure 54. The state
machine has two
independent output
channels, one shared
by OUT/SET, and
another used by side-
set (which can happen
at any time). Three
independent mappings
(first GPIO, number of
GPIOs) control which
GPIOs OUT, SET and
side-set are directed
to. Input data is
rotated according to
which GPIO is mapped
to the LSB of the IN
data.

###### The write data and write masks for the output level and output enable registers come from the following sources:

- An^ OUT^ instruction writes to up to 32 bits. Depending on the instruction’s^ Destination^ field, this is applied to either

###### pins or pindirs. The least-significant bit of OUT data is mapped to PINCTRL_OUT_BASE, and this mapping continues for

###### PINCTRL_OUT_COUNT bits, wrapping after GPIO31.

- A^ SET^ instruction writes up to 5 bits. Depending on the instruction’s^ Destination^ field, this is applied to either pins or

###### pindirs. The least-significant bit of SET data is mapped to PINCTRL_SET_BASE, and this mapping continues for

###### PINCTRL_SET_COUNT bits, wrapping after GPIO31.

- A side-set operation writes up to 5 bits. Depending on the register field^ EXECCTRL_SIDE_PINDIR, this is applied to either

###### pins or pindirs. The least-significant bit of side-set data is mapped to PINCTRL_SIDESET_BASE, continuing for

###### PINCTRL_SIDESET_COUNT pins, minus one if EXECCTRL_SIDE_EN is set.

###### Each OUT/SET/side-set operation writes to a contiguous range of pins, but each of these ranges is independently sized

###### and positioned in the 32-bit GPIO space. This is sufficiently flexible for many applications. For example, if one state

###### machine is implementing some interface such as an SPI on a group of pins, another state machine can run the same

###### program, mapped to a different group of pins, and provide a second SPI interface.

###### On any given clock cycle, the state machine may perform an OUT or a SET, and may simultaneously perform a side-set.

###### The pin mapping logic generates a 32-bit write mask and write data bus for the output level and output enable registers,

###### based on this request, and the pin mapping configuration.

###### If a side-set overlaps with an OUT/SET performed by that state machine on the same cycle, the side-set takes precedence

###### in the overlapping region.

##### 11.5.6.1. Output priority

Figure 55. Per-GPIO
priority select of write
masks from each
state machine. Each
GPIO considers level
and direction writes
from each of the four
state machines, and
applies the value from
the highest-numbered
state machine.

###### Each state machine may assert an OUT/SET and a side-set through its pin mapping hardware on each cycle. This

###### generates 32 bits of write data and write mask for the GPIO output level and output enable registers, from each state

###### machine.

###### For each GPIO, PIO collates the writes from all four state machines, and applies the write from the highest-numbered

###### 11.5. Functional details 912

###### state machine. This occurs separately for output levels and output values — it is possible for a state machine to change

###### both the level and direction of the same pin on the same cycle (e.g. via simultaneous SET and side-set), or for one state

###### machine to change a GPIO’s direction while another changes that GPIO’s level. If no state machine asserts a write to a

###### GPIO’s level or direction, the value does not change.

##### 11.5.6.2. Input mapping

###### The data observed by IN instructions is mapped such that the LSB is the GPIO selected by PINCTRL_IN_BASE, and

###### successively more-significant bits come from successively higher-numbered GPIOs, wrapping after 31.

###### In other words, the IN bus is a right-rotate of the GPIO input values, by PINCTRL_IN_BASE. If fewer than 32 GPIOs are

###### present, the PIO input is padded with zeroes up to 32 bits.

###### Some instructions, such as WAIT GPIO, use an absolute GPIO number, rather than an index into the IN data bus. In this

###### case, the right-rotate is not applied.

##### 11.5.6.3. Input synchronisers

###### To protect PIO from metastabilities, each GPIO input is equipped with a standard 2-flipflop synchroniser. This adds two

###### cycles of latency to input sampling, but the benefit is that state machines can perform an IN PINS at any point, and will

###### see only a clean high or low level, not some intermediate value that could disturb the state machine circuitry. This is

###### absolutely necessary for asynchronous interfaces such as UART RX.

###### It is possible to bypass these synchronisers, on a per-GPIO basis. This reduces input latency, but it is then up to the user

###### to guarantee that the state machine does not sample its inputs at inappropriate times. Generally this is only possible for

###### synchronous interfaces such as SPI. Synchronisers are bypassed by setting the corresponding bit in INPUT_SYNC_BYPASS.

#####  WARNING

###### Sampling a metastable input can lead to unpredictable state machine behaviour. This should be avoided.

#### 11.5.7. Forced and EXEC’d instructions

###### Besides the instruction memory, state machines can execute instructions from 3 other sources:

- MOV EXEC^ which executes an instruction from some register^ Source
- OUT EXEC^ which executes data shifted out from the OSR
- The^ SMx_INSTR^ control registers, to which the system can write instructions for immediate execution

###### Here we load an example program into the state machine, which does two things:

- Enters an infinite loop
- Enters a loop which repeatedly pulls 32 bits of data from the TX FIFO, and executes the lower 16 bits as an

###### instruction

###### The C program sets the state machine running, at which point it enters the hang loop. While the state machine is still

###### running, the C program forces in a jmp instruction, which causes the state machine to break out of the loop.

###### When an instruction is written to the INSTR register, the state machine immediately decodes and executes that

###### instruction, rather than the instruction it would have fetched from the PIO’s instruction memory. The program counter

###### does not advance, so on the next cycle (assuming the instruction forced into the INSTR interface did not stall) the state

###### machine continues to execute its current program from the point where it left off, unless the written instruction itself

###### manipulated PC.

###### Delay cycles are ignored on instructions written to the INSTR register, and execute immediately, ignoring the state

###### machine clock divider. This interface is provided for performing initial setup and effecting control flow changes, so it

###### executes instructions in a timely manner, no matter how the state machine is configured.

###### Instructions written to the INSTR register are permitted to stall, in which case the state machine will latch this instruction

###### internally until it completes. This is signified by the EXECCTRL_EXEC_STALLED flag. This can be cleared by restarting the state

###### 11.5. Functional details 914

###### machine, or writing a NOP to INSTR.

###### In the second phase of the example state machine program, the OUT EXEC instruction is used. The OUT itself occupies one

###### execution cycle, and the instruction which the OUT executes is on the next execution cycle. Note that one of the

###### instructions we execute is also an OUT — the state machine is only capable of executing one OUT instruction on any given

###### cycle.

###### OUT EXEC works by writing the OUT shift data to an internal instruction latch. On the next cycle, the state machine

###### remembers it must execute from this latch rather than the instruction memory, and also knows to not advance PC on this

###### second cycle.

###### This program will print "12345678" when run.

 (^) CAUTION

###### If an instruction written to INSTR stalls, it is stored in the same instruction latch used by OUT EXEC and MOV EXEC, and will

###### overwrite an in-progress instruction there. If EXEC instructions are used, instructions written to INSTR must not stall.

## 11.6. Examples

###### These examples illustrate some of PIO’s hardware features, by implementing common I/O interfaces.

 (^) TIP

###### Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK has a comprehensive PIO chapter that begins with writing and building your

###### first PIO application. Later chapters walk through some programs line-by-line. Finally, it covers broader topics such

###### as using PIO with DMA, and how PIO can integrate into your software.

#### 11.6.1. Duplex SPI

###### 11.6. Examples 915

Figure 56. In SPI, a
host and device
exchange data over a
bidirectional pair of
serial data lines,
synchronous with a
clock (SCK). Two
flags, CPOL and
CPHA, specify the
clock’s behaviour.
CPOL is the idle state
of the clock: 0 for low,
1 for high. The clock
pulses a number of
times, transferring one
bit in each direction
per pulse, but always
returns to its idle
state. CPHA
determines on which
edge of the clock data
is captured: 0 for
leading edge, and 1 for
trailing edge. The
arrows in the figure
show the clock edge
where data is captured
by both the host and
device.

###### SPI is a common serial interface with a twisty history. The following program implements full-duplex (i.e. transferring

###### data in both directions simultaneously) SPI, with a CPHA parameter of 0.

###### A C helper function configures the state machine, connects the GPIOs, and sets the state machine running. Note that

###### the SPI frame size — that is, the number of bits transferred for each FIFO record — can be programmed to any value

###### from 1 to 32, without modifying the program. Once configured, the state machine is set running.

#### 11.6.2. WS2812 LEDs

###### WS2812 LEDs are driven by a proprietary pulse-width serial format, with a wide positive pulse representing a "1" bit, and

###### narrow positive pulse a "0". Each LED has a serial input and a serial output; LEDs are connected in a chain, with each

###### serial input connected to the previous LED’s serial output.

###### LEDs consume 24 bits of pixel data, then pass any additional input data on to their output. In this way a single serial

###### burst can individually program the colour of each LED in a chain. A long negative pulse latches the pixel data into the

###### LEDs.

###### This program shifts bits from the OSR into X, and produces a wide or narrow pulse on side-set pin 0, based on the value

###### of each data bit. Autopull must be configured, with a threshold of 24. Software can then write 24-bit pixel values into the

###### FIFO, and these will be serialised to a chain of WS2812 LEDs. The .pio file contains a C helper function to set this up:

```

```
###### Because the shift is MSB-first, and our pixels aren’t a power of two size (so we can’t rely on the narrow write replication

###### behaviour on RP2350 to fan out the bits for us), we need to preshift the values written to the TX FIFO.

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/ws2812/ws2812.c Lines 43 - 45
43 static inline void put_pixel(PIO pio, uint sm, uint32_t pixel_grb) {
44 pio_sm_put_blocking(pio, sm, pixel_grb << 8u);
45 }
```
###### To DMA the pixels, we could instead set the autopull threshold to 8 bits, set the DMA transfer size to 8 bits, and write a

###### byte at a time into the FIFO. Each pixel would be 3 one-byte transfers. Because of how the bus fabric and DMA on

###### RP2350 work, each byte the DMA transfers will appear replicated four times when written to a 32-bit IO register, so

###### effectively your data is at both ends of the shift register, and you can shift in either direction without worry.

###### 11.6. Examples 920

#####  TIP

###### The WS2812 example is the subject of a tutorial in the Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK document, in the PIO

###### chapter. The tutorial dissects the ws2812 program line by line, traces through how the program executes, and shows

###### wave diagrams of the GPIO output at every point in the program.

(the "start bit"), and a
small, fixed number of
data bits follows. The
line returns to the idle
state for at least one
bit period (the "stop
bit") before the next
serial frame can
begin.

###### This program implements the transmit component of a universal asynchronous receive/transmit (UART) serial

###### peripheral. Perhaps it would be more correct to refer to this as a UAT.

```

###### As written, it will:

###### 1. Stall with the pin driven high until data appears (noting that side-set takes effect even when the state machine is

###### stalled)

###### 2. Assert a start bit, for 8 SM execution cycles

###### 3. Shift out 8 data bits, each lasting for 8 cycles

###### 4. Return to the idle line state for at least 8 cycles before asserting the next start bit

###### If the state machine’s clock divider is configured to run at 8 times the desired baud rate, this program will transmit well-

###### formed UART serial frames, whenever data is pushed to the TX FIFO either by software or the system DMA. To extend

###### the program to cover different frame sizes (different numbers of data bits), the set x, 7 could be replaced with mov x, y,

###### so that the y scratch register becomes a per-SM configuration register for UART frame size.

###### The .pio file in the SDK also contains this function, for configuring the pins and the state machine, once the program

###### has been loaded into the PIO instruction memory:

#### 11.6.4. UART RX

###### Recalling Figure 58 showing the format of an 8n1 UART:

```
Bit Clock
TX
State
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Idle Start Data (LSB first) Stop
```
###### We can recover the data by waiting for the start bit, sampling 8 times with the correct timing, and pushing the result to

###### the RX FIFO. Below is possibly the shortest program which can do this:

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/uart_rx/uart_rx.pio Lines 8 - 19
8 .program uart_rx_mini
9
10 ; Minimum viable 8n1 UART receiver. Wait for the start bit, then sample 8 bits
11 ; with the correct timing.
12 ; IN pin 0 is mapped to the GPIO used as UART RX.
13 ; Autopush must be enabled, with a threshold of 8.
14
15 wait 0 pin 0 ; Wait for start bit
16 set x, 7 [10] ; Preload bit counter, delay until eye of first data bit
17 bitloop: ; Loop 8 times
18 in pins, 1 ; Sample data
19 jmp x-- bitloop [6] ; Each iteration is 8 cycles
```
###### This works, but it has some annoying characteristics, like repeatedly outputting NUL characters if the line is stuck low.

###### 11.6. Examples 923

###### Ideally, we would want to drop data that is not correctly framed by a start and stop bit (and set some sticky flag to

###### indicate this has happened), and pause receiving when the line is stuck low for long periods. We can add these to our

###### program, at the cost of a few more instructions.

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/uart_rx/uart_rx.pio Lines 44 - 63
44 .program uart_rx
45
46 ; Slightly more fleshed-out 8n1 UART receiver which handles framing errors and
47 ; break conditions more gracefully.
48 ; IN pin 0 and JMP pin are both mapped to the GPIO used as UART RX.
49
50 start:
51 wait 0 pin 0 ; Stall until start bit is asserted
52 set x, 7 [10] ; Preload bit counter, then delay until halfway through
53 bitloop: ; the first data bit (12 cycles incl wait, set).
54 in pins, 1 ; Shift data bit into ISR
55 jmp x-- bitloop [6] ; Loop 8 times, each loop iteration is 8 cycles
56 jmp pin good_stop ; Check stop bit (should be high)
57
58 irq 4 rel ; Either a framing error or a break. Set a sticky flag,
59 wait 1 pin 0 ; and wait for line to return to idle state.
60 jmp start ; Don't push data if we didn't see good framing.
61
62 good_stop: ; No delay before returning to start; a little slack is
63 push ; important in case the TX clock is slightly too fast.
```
###### The second example does not use autopush (Section 11.5.4), preferring instead to use an explicit push instruction, so

###### that it can condition the push on whether a correct stop bit is seen. The .pio file includes a helper function which

###### configures the state machine and connects it to a GPIO with the pull-up enabled:

```

85 }
```
###### To correctly receive data which is sent LSB-first, the ISR is configured to shift to the right. After shifting in 8 bits, this

###### unfortunately leaves our 8 data bits in bits 31:24 of the ISR, with 24 zeroes in the LSBs. One option here is an in null, 24

###### instruction to shuffle the ISR contents down to 7:0. Another is to read from the FIFO at an offset of 3 bytes, with an 8-bit

###### read, so that the processor’s bus hardware (or the DMA’s) picks out the relevant byte for free:

###### 11.6. Examples 924

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/uart_rx/uart_rx.pio Lines 87 - 93
87 static inline char uart_rx_program_getc(PIO pio, uint sm) {

93 }
```
###### An example program shows how this UART RX program can be used to receive characters sent by one of the hardware

###### UARTs on RP2350. A wire must be connected from GPIO4 to GPIO3 for this program to function. To make the wrangling

###### of 3 different serial ports a little easier, this program uses core 1 to print out a string on the test UART (UART 1), and the

###### code running on core 0 will pull out characters from the PIO state machine, and pass them along to the UART used for

###### the debug console (UART 0). Another approach here would be interrupt-based IO, using PIO’s FIFO IRQs. If the

###### SM0_RXNEMPTY bit is set in the IRQ0_INTE register, then PIO will raise its first interrupt request line whenever there is a

###### character in state machine 0’s RX FIFO.

#### 11.6.6. Differential Manchester (BMC) TX and RX

Figure 60. Differential
Manchester serial line
code, also known as
biphase mark code
(BMC). The line
transitions at the start
of every bit period.
The presence of a
transition in the centre
of the bit period
signifies a 1 data bit,
and the absence, a 0
bit. These encoding
rules are the same
whether the line has
an initial high or low
state.

###### The transmit program is similar to the Manchester example: it repeatedly shifts a bit from the OSR into X (relying on

###### autopull to refill the OSR in the background), branches, and drives a GPIO up and down based on the value of this bit.

###### The added complication is that the pattern we drive onto the pin depends not just on the value of the data bit, as with

###### vanilla Manchester encoding, but also on the state the line was left in at the end of the last bit period. This is illustrated

###### in Figure 60, where the pattern is inverted if the line is initially high. To cope with this, there are two copies of the test-

###### and-drive code, one for each initial line state, and these are linked together in the correct order by a sequence of jumps.

#### 11.6.7. I2C

Figure 61. A 1-byte I2C
read transfer. In the
idle state, both lines
float high. The initiator
drives SDA low (a
Start condition),
followed by 7 address
bits A6-A0, and a
direction bit
(Read/nWrite). The
target drives SDA low
to acknowledge the
address (ACK). Data
bytes follow. The
target serialises data
on SDA, clocked out
by SCL. Every 9th
clock, the initiator
pulls SDA low to
acknowledge the data,
except on the last
byte, where it leaves
the line high (NAK).
Releasing SDA whilst
SCL is high is a Stop
condition, returning
the bus to idle.

###### I2C is an ubiquitous serial bus first described in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and later used by Philips Semiconductor. Two

###### wires with pullup resistors form an open-drain bus, and multiple agents address and signal one another over this bus by

###### driving the bus lines low, or releasing them to be pulled high. It has a number of unusual attributes:

- SCL can be held low at any time, for any duration, by any member of the bus (not necessarily the target or initiator

###### of the transfer). This is known as clock stretching. The bus does not advance until all drivers release the clock.

- Members of the bus can be a target of one transfer and initiate other transfers (the master/slave roles are not

###### fixed). However this is poorly supported by most I2C hardware.

- SCL is not an edge-sensitive clock, rather SDA must be valid the entire time SCL is high.
- In spite of the transparency of SDA against SCL, transitions of SDA whilst SCL is high are used to mark beginning

###### and end of transfers (Start/Stop), or a new address phase within one (Restart).

###### The PIO program listed below handles serialisation, clock stretching, and checking of ACKs in the initiator role. It

###### provides a mechanism for escaping PIO instructions in the FIFO datastream, to issue Start/Stop/Restart sequences at

###### appropriate times. Provided no unexpected NAKs are received, this can perform long sequences of I2C transfers from a

###### DMA buffer, without processor intervention.

#### 11.6.8. PWM

Figure 62. Pulse width
modulation (PWM).
The state machine
outputs positive
voltage pulses at
regular intervals. The
width of these pulses
is controlled, so that
the line is high for
some controlled
fraction of the time
(the duty cycle). One
use of this is to
smoothly vary the
brightness of an LED,
by pulsing it faster
than human
persistence of vision.

###### This program repeatedly counts down to 0 with the Y register, whilst comparing the Y count to a pulse width held in the

###### X register. The output is asserted low before counting begins, and asserted high when the value in Y reaches X. Once Y

###### reaches 0, the process repeats, and the output is once more driven low. The fraction of time that the output is high is

###### therefore proportional to the pulse width stored in X.

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/pwm/pwm.pio Lines 10 - 22
10 .program pwm
11 .side_set 1 opt
12
13 pull noblock side 0 ; Pull from FIFO to OSR if available, else copy X to OSR.
14 mov x, osr ; Copy most-recently-pulled value back to scratch X
15 mov y, isr ; ISR contains PWM period. Y used as counter.
16 countloop:
17 jmp x!=y noset ; Set pin high if X == Y, keep the two paths length matched
18 jmp skip side 1
19 noset:
20 nop ; Single dummy cycle to keep the two paths the same length
21 skip:
22 jmp y-- countloop ; Loop until Y hits 0, then pull a fresh PWM value from FIFO
```
###### Often, a PWM can be left at a particular pulse width for thousands of pulses, rather than supplying a new pulse width

###### each time. This example highlights how a non-blocking PULL (Section 11.4.7) can achieve this: if the TX FIFO is empty, a

###### non-blocking PULL will copy X to the OSR. After pulling, the program copies the OSR into X, so that it can be compared to

###### the count value in Y. The net effect is that, if a new duty cycle value has not been supplied through the TX FIFO at the

###### start of this period, the duty cycle from the previous period (which has been copied from X to OSR via the failed PULL, and

###### then back to X via the MOV) is reused, for as many periods as necessary.

###### Another useful technique shown here is using the ISR as a configuration register, if IN instructions are not required.

###### System software can load an arbitrary 32-bit value into the ISR (by executing instructions directly on the state machine),

###### and the program will copy this value into Y each time it begins counting. The ISR can be used to configure the range of

###### PWM counting, and the state machine’s clock divider controls the rate of counting.

###### To start modulating some pulses, we first need to map the state machine’s side-set pins to the GPIO we want to output

###### PWM on, and tell the state machine where the program is loaded in the PIO instruction memory:

```
Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/pwm/pwm.pio Lines 25 - 31
25 static inline void pwm_program_init(PIO pio, uint sm, uint offset, uint pin) {
26 pio_gpio_init(pio, pin);
27 pio_sm_set_consecutive_pindirs(pio, sm, pin, 1, true);

###### 11.6. Examples 936

29 sm_config_set_sideset_pins(&c, pin);
30 pio_sm_init(pio, sm, offset, &c);
31 }
```
###### A little footwork is required to load the ISR with the desired counting range:

```

14 void pio_pwm_set_period(PIO pio, uint sm, uint32_t period) {

18 pio_sm_exec(pio, sm, pio_encode_out(pio_isr, 32));
19 pio_sm_set_enabled(pio, sm, true);

###### pulse. Once the FIFO runs dry, the program will again start reusing the most recently supplied value.

#### 11.6.9. Addition

###### Although not designed for computation, PIO is quite likely Turing-complete, provided a long enough piece of tape can be

###### found. It is conjectured that it could run DOOM, given a sufficiently high clock speed.

#### 11.6.10. Further examples

###### Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK has a PIO chapter which goes into depth on some software-centric topics not

###### presented here. It includes a PIO + DMA logic analyser example that can sample every GPIO on every cycle (a bandwidth

###### of nearly 4Gbps at 125 MHz, although this does fill up RP2350’s RAM somewhat quickly).

###### There are also further examples in the pio/ directory in the Pico Examples repository.

###### Some of the more experimental example code, such as DPI and SD card support, is currently located in the Pico Extras

###### and Pico Playground repositories. The PIO parts of these are functional, but the surrounding software stacks are still in

###### an experimental state.
