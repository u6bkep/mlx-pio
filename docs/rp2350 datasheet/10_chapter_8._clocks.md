# Chapter 8. Clocks

## 8.1. Overview

## The clocks block provides independent clocks to on-chip and external components. It takes inputs from a variety of

## clock sources, allowing the user to trade off performance against cost, board area and power consumption. From these

## sources it uses multiple clock generators to provide the required clocks. This architecture allows the user flexibility to

## start and stop clocks independently and to vary some clock frequencies whilst maintaining others at their optimum

## frequencies.

overview

## The crystal oscillator (XOSC) provides a reference to two PLLs, which provide high precision clocks to the processors

## and peripherals. These are slow to start when waking from the various low-power modes, so the on-chip ring oscillator

## (ROSC) is provided to boot the device until they are available. When the switched-core is powered down or the device is

## in DORMANT mode (see Section 6.5.3, “DORMANT state”) the on-chip 32kHz low-power oscillator (LPOSC) provides a

## clock to the power manager and a tick to the Always-on Timer (AON Timer).

## 8.1. Overview 513

###### The clock generators select from the clock sources and optionally divide the selected clock before outputting through

###### enable logic that provides automatic clock gating in sleep mode (see Section 8.1.3.5.2, “System sleep mode”).

###### An on-chip frequency counter facilitates debugging of the clock setup and also allows measurement of the frequencies

###### of LPOSC, ROSC and external clocks. If the system clock stops accidentally, the on-chip resus (short for resuscitate)

###### component restarts it from a known good clock. This allows the software debugger to access registers and debug the

###### problem.

###### When the switched-core is powered, the power manager clock automatically switches to the reference clock (clk_ref).

###### The user can optionally switch the AON Timer tick, though we recommend waiting until clk_ref is running from the

###### XOSC, because the ROSC frequency is imprecise.

###### You can substitute the clock sources with up to 2 GPIO clock inputs. This helps avoid adding a second crystal into

###### systems that already have an accurate clock source and enables replacement of the ROSC and LPOSC with more

###### accurate external sources.

###### You can also output up to 4 generated clocks to GPIOs at up to 50MHz. This enables you to supply clocks to external

###### devices, reducing the need for additional clock components that consume power and board area.

### 8.1.1. Changes between RP2350 revisions

###### RP2350 A3 changes the reset values of:

- CLK_SYS_CTRL.SRC from^0 to^1 (select AUX source).
- CLK_SYS_CTRL.AUXSRC from^0 to^2 (select ROSC as AUX source).

###### See Hardware changes for information about related changes made to the ROSC configuration at reset. See Bootrom

###### changes for related changes made in the A3 boot ROM.

### 8.1.2. Clock sources

###### RP2350 can use a variety of clock sources. This flexibility allows the user to optimise the clock setup for performance,

###### cost, board area and power consumption. RP2350 supports the following potential clock sources:

- On-chip 32kHz low-power oscillator (Section 8.4, “Low Power oscillator (LPOSC)”)
- On-chip ring oscillator (Section 8.3, “Ring oscillator (ROSC)”)
- Crystal oscillator (Section 8.2, “Crystal oscillator (XOSC)”)
- External clocks from GPIOs (Section 8.1.6.4, “Configuring a GPIO input clock”) and PLLs (Section 8.6, “PLL”)

###### The list of clock sources is different per clock generator and can be found as enumerated values in the CTRL register.

###### See CLK_SYS_CTRL as an example.

#### 8.1.2.1. Low-power oscillator

###### The on-chip 32kHz low-power oscillator (Section 8.4, “Low Power oscillator (LPOSC)”) requires no external components.

###### It starts automatically when the always-on domain is powered, providing a clock for the power manager and a tick for

###### the Always-on Timer (AON Timer) when the switched-core power domain is powered off.

###### The LPOSC can be tuned to 1% accuracy, and the divider in the AON Timer tick generator can further tune the 1ms tick.

###### However, the LPOSC frequency varies with voltage and temperature, so fine-tuning is only useful in systems with stable

###### voltage and temperature.

###### When the switched-core is powered, the LPOSC clock can drive the reference clock (clk_ref), which in turn can drive the

###### system clock (clk_sys). This allows another low-power mode where the processors remain powered but, unlike the

###### SLEEP and DORMANT modes, clocks are running. The LPOSC clock can also be sent to the frequency counter for

###### calibration or output to a GPIO.

###### 8.1. Overview 514

#### 8.1.2.2. Ring oscillator

###### The on-chip ring oscillator (Section 8.3, “Ring oscillator (ROSC)”) requires no external components. It starts

###### automatically when the switched-core domain is powered and is used to clock the chip during the initial boot stages.

###### During boot, the ROSC runs at a nominal 11MHz, but varies with PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature). The ROSC

###### frequency is guaranteed to be in the range 4.6MHz to 19.6MHz.

###### For low-cost applications where frequency accuracy is unimportant, the chip can continue to run from the ROSC. If your

###### application requires greater performance, the frequency can be increased by programming the registers as described in

###### Section 8.3, “Ring oscillator (ROSC)”. Because the frequency varies with PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature), the

###### user must take care to avoid exceeding the maximum frequencies described in the clock generators section. For

###### information about reducing this variation when running the ROSC at frequencies close to the maximum, see Section

###### 8.1.2.2.1, “Mitigate ROSC frequency variation due to process”. Alternatively, use an external clock or the XOSC to

###### provide a stable reference clock and use the PLLs to generate higher frequencies. However, this approach requires

###### external components, which will cost board area and increase power consumption.

###### When using an external clock or the XOSC, you can stop the ROSC to save power. Before stopping the ROSC, you must

###### switch the reference clock generator and the system clock generator to an alternate source.

###### The ROSC is unpowered when the switched-core domain is powered down, but starts immediately when the switched-

###### core powers up. It is not affected by sleep mode. To save power, reduce the frequency before entering sleep mode.

###### When entering DORMANT mode, the ROSC is automatically stopped. When exiting DORMANT mode, the ROSC restarts

###### in the same configuration. If you drive clocks at close to their maximum frequencies with the ROSC, drop the frequency

###### before entering SLEEP or DORMANT mode. This allows for frequency variation due to changes in environmental

###### conditions during SLEEP or DORMANT mode.

###### To use ROSC clock externally, output it to a GPIO pin using one of the clk_gpclk0-3 generators.

###### The following sections describe techniques for mitigating PVT variation of the ROSC frequency. They also provide some

###### interesting design challenges for use in teaching both the effects of PVT and writing software to control real time

###### functions.

####  TIP

###### Because the ROSC frequency varies with PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature), you can use the ROSC frequency

###### to measure any one of the three PVT variables as long as you know the other two variables.

##### 8.1.2.2.1. Mitigate ROSC frequency variation due to process

###### Process varies for the following reasons:

- Chips leave the factory with a spread of process parameters. This causes variation in the ROSC frequency across

###### chips.

- Process parameters vary slightly as the chip ages. This is only observable over many thousands of hours of

###### operation.

###### To mitigate process variation, the user can characterise individual chips and program the ROSC frequency accordingly.

###### This is an adequate solution for small numbers of chips, but does not scale well to volume production. For high-volume

###### applications, consider using automatic mitigation.

##### 8.1.2.2.2. Mitigate ROSC frequency variation due to voltage

###### Supply voltage varies for the following reasons:

- The power supply itself can vary.
- As chip activity varies, on-chip IR varies.

###### To mitigate voltage variation, calibrate for the minimum performance target of your application, then adjust the ROSC

###### 8.1. Overview 515

###### frequency to always exceed that minimum.

##### 8.1.2.2.3. Mitigate ROSC frequency variation due to temperature

###### Temperature varies for the following reasons:

- The ambient temperature can vary.
- The chip temperature varies as chip activity varies due to self-heating.

###### To mitigate temperature variations, stabilise the temperature. You can use a temperature controlled environment,

###### passive cooling, or active cooling. Alternatively, track the temperature using the on-chip temperature sensor and adjust

###### the ROSC frequency so it remains within the required bounds.

##### 8.1.2.2.4. Automatic mitigation of ROSC frequency variation due to PVT

###### Techniques for automatic ROSC frequency control avoid the need to calibrate individual chips, but require periodic

###### access to a clock reference or to a time reference.

###### If a clock reference is available, you can use it to periodically measure the ROSC frequency and adjust accordingly. The

###### on-chip XOSC is one potential clock reference. You can even run the XOSC intermittently to save power for very low-

###### power application where it is too costly to run the XOSC continuously or use the PLLs to achieve high frequencies.

###### If a time reference is available, you can clock the on-chip AON Timer from the ROSC and periodically compare it against

###### the time reference, adjusting the ROSC frequency as necessary. Using these techniques, the ROSC frequency still drifts

###### due to voltage and temperature variation. As a result, you should also implement mitigations for voltage and

###### temperature to ensure that variations do not allow the ROSC frequency to drift out of the acceptable range.

##### 8.1.2.2.5. Automatic overclocking using the ROSC

###### The datasheet maximum frequencies for any digital device are quoted for worst case PVT. Most chips in most normal

###### environments can run significantly faster than the quoted maximum, and therefore support overclocking. When RP

###### runs from the ROSC, PVT affects both both the ROSC and the digital components. As the ROSC gets faster, the

###### processors can also run faster. This means the user can overclock from the ROSC, then rely on the ROSC frequency

###### tracking with PVT variations. The tracking of ROSC frequency and the processor capability is not perfect, and currently

###### there is insufficient data to specify a safe ROSC setting for this mode of operation, so some experimentation is

###### required.

###### This mode of operation maximises processor performance, but causes variations in the time taken to complete a task.

###### Only use overclocking for applications where this variation is acceptable. If your application uses frequency sensitive

###### interfaces such as USB or UART, you must use the XOSC and PLL to provide a precise clock for those components.

#### 8.1.2.3. Crystal oscillator

###### The Crystal Oscillator (Section 8.2, “Crystal oscillator (XOSC)”) provides a precise, stable clock reference and should be

###### used where accurate timing is required and no suitable external clocks are available. The XOSC requires an external

###### crystal component. The external crystal determines the frequency. RP2350 supports 1MHz to 50MHz crystals and the

###### RP2350 reference design (see Hardware design with RP2350, Minimal Design Example) uses a 12MHz crystal. Using

###### the XOSC and the PLLs, you can run on-chip components at their maximum frequencies. Appropriate margin is built into

###### the design to tolerate up to 1000ppm variation in the XOSC frequency.

###### The XOSC is unpowered when the switched-core domain is powered down. It remains inactive when the switched-core

###### is powered up. If required, you must enable it in software. XOSC startup takes several milliseconds, and software must

###### wait for the XOSC_STABLE flag to be set before starting the PLLs and changing any clock generators. Before the XOSC

###### completes startup, output might be non-existent or exhibit very short pulse widths; this will corrupt logic if used. When

###### XOSC startup is complete, the reference clock (clk_ref) and the system clock (clk_sys) can run from the XOSC. If you

###### 8.1. Overview 516

###### switch the system and reference clocks to run from the XOSC, you can stop the ROSC to save power.

###### The XOSC is not affected by sleep mode. It automatically stops and restarts in the same configuration when entering

###### and exiting DORMANT mode.

###### To use the XOSC clock externally, output it to a GPIO pin using one of the clk_gpclk0-clk_gpclk03 generators. You cannot

###### take XOSC output directly from the XIN (XI) or XOUT (XO) pins.

#### 8.1.2.4. External clocks

###### If external clocks exist in the hardware design, you can use them to clock RP2350. You can use clocks individually or in

###### conjunction with the other (internal or external) clock sources. Use XIN and one of GPIN0-GPIN1 to input external

###### clocks.

###### If you drive an external clock into XIN, you don’t need an external crystal. When driving an external clock into XIN, you

###### must configure the XOSC to pass through the XIN signal. When the switched-core powers down, this configuration will

###### be lost, but the configuration is unaffected by SLEEP and DORMANT modes. The input is limited to 50MHz, but the on-

###### chip PLLs can synthesise higher frequencies from the XIN input if required.

###### GPIN0-GPIN1 can provide system and peripherals clocks, but is limited to 50MHz. This can potentially save power and

###### allows components on RP2350 to run synchronously with external components, which simplifies data transfer between

###### chips. If the frequency accuracy of the external clocks is poorer than 1000ppm, the generated clocks should not run at

###### their maximum frequencies since they could exceed their design margins. Once the external clocks begin to run, the

###### reference clock (clk_ref) and the system clock (clk_sys) can run from the external clocks and you can stop the ROSC to

###### save power. When the switched-core powers down, GPIN0-GPIN1 configuration will be lost, but the configuration is

###### unaffected by SLEEP and DORMANT modes.

###### To provide a more accurate tick to the AON Timer, use one of the GPIN0-GPIN3 inputs to replace the clock from the

###### LPOSC. These inputs are limited to 29MHz. GPIN0-GPIN3 configuration is unaffected by switched-core power down,

###### sleep mode, and DORMANT mode.

#### 8.1.2.5. Relaxation oscillators

###### If there is no appropriate clock available, but you still want to replace or supplement external clocks with another clock

###### source, you can construct one or two relaxation oscillators from external passive components. Send the clock source

###### (GPIN0-GPIN1) to one of the clk_gpclk0-clk_gpclk03 generators, invert it through the GPIO inverter OUTOVER, and connect

###### back to the clock source input via an RC circuit:

Figure 34. Simple
relaxation oscillator
example

###### The frequency of clocks generated from relaxation oscillators depend on the delay through the chip and the drive

###### current from the GPIO output, both of which vary with PVT. The frequency and frequency accuracy depend on the

###### quality and accuracy of the external components. More elaborate external components such as ceramic resonators, can

###### improve performance, but also increase cost and complexity. Such an oscillator will not achieve 1000ppm, so they

###### cannot drive internal clocks at their maximum frequencies. To drive internal clocks at the maximum possible frequency,

###### use the XOSC.

###### The configuration of the relaxation oscillators will be lost when the switched-core powers down, but is not affected by

###### sleep mode or DORMANT mode.

###### 8.1. Overview 517

#### 8.1.2.6. PLLs

###### The PLLs (Section 8.6, “PLL”) are used to provide fast clocks when running from the XOSC or an external clock source

###### driven into the XIN pin. In a fully-featured application, the USB PLL provides a fixed 48MHz clock to the ADC and USB

###### while clk_ref is driven from the XOSC or external clock source. This allows the user to drive clk_sys from the system PLL

###### and vary the frequency according to demand to save power without having to change the setups of the other clocks.

###### clk_peri can be driven either from the fixed frequency USB PLL or from the variable frequency system PLL. If clk_sys

###### never needs to exceed 48MHz, one PLL can be used and the divider in the clk_sys clock generator can scale the clk_sys

###### frequency according to demand.

###### When a PLL starts, you cannot use the output until the PLL locks as indicated by the LOCK bit in the STATUS register. As a

###### result, the PLL output cannot be used during changes to the reference clock divider, the output dividers or the bypass

###### mode. The output can be used during feedback divisor changes, though the output frequency might overshoot or

###### undershoot during large changes to the feedback divisor. For more information, see Section 8.6, “PLL”.

###### The PLLs can drive clocks at their maximum frequency as long as the reference clock is accurate to 1000ppm, since

###### this keeps the frequency of the generated clocks within design margins.

###### The PLLs are not affected by sleep mode. To save power in sleep mode, switch all clock generators away from the PLLs

###### stop them in software before entering sleep mode.

###### The PLLs do not stop and restart automatically when entering and exiting DORMANT mode. If the PLLs are running

###### when entering DORMANT mode, they will be corrupted because the reference clock in the XOSC stops. This generates

###### out-of-control clocks that consume power unnecessarily. Before entering DORMANT mode, always switch all clock

###### generators away from the PLLs and stop the PLLs in software.

### 8.1.3. Clock generators

###### The clock generators are built on a standard design that incorporates clock source multiplexing, division, duty cycle

###### correction, and sleep mode enabling. To save chip area and power, some individual clock generators omit certain

###### features.

Figure 35. A generic
clock generator

###### clk_hstx HSTX clock. 150MHz

###### For a full list of clock sources for each clock generator, see the appropriate CTRL register. For example, CLK_SYS_CTRL.

#### 8.1.3.2. Multiplexers

###### All clock generators have a multiplexer referred to as the auxiliary (aux) mux. This mux has a conventional design

###### whose output will glitch when changing the select control. The reference clock (clk_ref) and the system clock (clk_sys)

###### have an additional multiplexer referred to as the glitchless mux. The glitchless mux can switch between clock sources

###### without generating a glitch on the output.

###### Before switching the clock source of an auxiliary mux you must either:

- Temporarily switch the glitchless mux away from aux (if a glitchless mux is available).
- Temporarily disable the clock generator using its^ CTRL_ENABLE^ bit.
- Hold the destination in reset so that a potential clock glitch doesn’t cause undefined operation.

###### Failure to do at least one of the above can cause a glitch on the clock input of all hardware currently clocked by this

###### clock generator. Avoid clock glitches at all costs; they can corrupt the logic running from the clock.

###### Clock generators require two cycles of the source clock to stop the output and two cycles of the new source to restart

###### the output. Wait for the generator to stop before changing the auxiliary mux. When the destination clock is much slower

###### than the system clock, there is a danger that software changes the aux mux source before the clock generator has

###### come to a safe halt. Avoid this by polling the clock generator’s CTRL_ENABLED status until it matches the value of

###### CTRL_ENABLE.

###### The glitchless mux is only implemented for always-on clocks. On RP2350, the always-on clocks are the reference clock

###### (clk_ref) and the system clock (clk_sys). Such clocks must run continuously unless the chip is in DORMANT mode. The

###### glitchless mux has a status output (SELECTED) that indicates which source is selected. You can read this status output

###### from software to confirm that a change of clock source has completed.

###### The recommended control sequences are as follows.

###### To switch between clock sources for the glitchless mux:

###### 1. Switch the glitchless mux to an alternate source.

###### 2. Poll the SELECTED register until the switch completes.

###### To switch between clock sources for the aux mux when the generator has a glitchless mux:

###### 1. Switch the glitchless mux to a source that isn’t the aux mux.

###### 2. Poll the SELECTED register until the switch completes.

###### 3. Change the auxiliary mux select control.

###### 8.1. Overview 519

###### 4. Switch the glitchless mux back to the aux mux.

###### 5. If required, poll the SELECTED register until the switch completes.

###### To switch between clock sources for the aux mux when the generator does not have a glitchless mux:

###### 1. Disable the clock divider.

###### 2. Wait for the generated clock to stop (two cycles of the clock source).

###### 3. Change the auxiliary mux select control.

###### 4. Enable the clock divider.

###### 5. If required, wait for the clock generator to restart (two cycles of the clock source).

###### See Section 8.1.6.1, “Configuring a clock generator” for a code example of this.

#### 8.1.3.3. Divider

###### A fully featured divider divides by a fractional number in the range 1.0 to 2^16. Fractional division is achieved by toggling

###### between 2 integer divisors; this yields a jittery clock that might be unsuitable for some applications. For example, when

###### dividing by 2.4, the divider divides by 2 for 3 cycles and by 3 for 2 cycles. For divisors with large integer components, the

###### jitter will be much smaller and less critical.

Figure 36. An example
of fractional division.

###### All dividers support on-the-fly divisor changes: the output clock can switch cleanly from one divisor to another. The

###### clock generator does not need to be stopped during clock divisor changes, because the dividers synchronise the divisor

###### change to the end of the clock cycle. Similarly, dividers synchronise the enable to the end of the clock cycle to avoid

###### glitches when the clock generator is enabled or disabled. Clock generators for always-on clocks are permanently

###### enabled and therefore do not have an enable control.

###### In the event that a clock generator locks up and never completes the current clock cycle, it can be forced to stop using

###### the KILL control. This can result in an output glitch, which can corrupt the logic driven by the clock. Always reset the

###### destination logic before using the KILL control. Clock generators for always-on clocks are permanently active and

###### therefore do not have a KILL control.

####  NOTE

###### This clock generator design has been used in numerous chips and has never been known to lock up. The KILL control

###### is inelegant and unnecessary and should not be used as an alternative to the enable.

#### 8.1.3.4. Duty cycle correction

###### The divider operates on the rising edge of the input clock, so it does not generate an even duty cycle clock when dividing

###### by odd numbers. For example, divide by 3 gives a duty cycle of 33.3%, and divide by 5 gives a duty cycle of 40%.

###### If enabled, duty cycle correction logic will shift the falling edge of the output clock to the falling edge of the input clock

###### and restore a 50% duty cycle. The duty cycle correction can be enabled and disabled while the clock is running. It

###### doesn’t operate when dividing by an even number.

duty_cycle_correction.

#### 8.1.3.5. Clock Enables

###### Each clock goes to multiple destinations. With a few exceptions, each destination has two enables. Use the WAKE_EN

###### registers to enable the clocks when the system is awake. Use the SLEEP_EN registers to enable the clocks when the

###### system is in sleep mode. Enables help reduce power in the clock distribution networks for unused components. Any

###### component that isn’t clocked will retain its configuration so it can restart quickly.

####  NOTE

###### By default, the WAKE_EN and SLEEP_EN registers reset to 0x1, which enables all clocks. Only use this feature for low-

###### power designs.

##### 8.1.3.5.1. Clock enable exceptions

###### The following destinations don’t have clock enables:

- The^ clk_gpclk0-clk_gpclk03^ generators.
- The processor cores, because they require a clock at all times to manage their own power-saving features.
- clk_sys_busfabric^ (in wake mode), because that would prevent the cores from accessing any chip registers,

###### including those that control the clock enables.

- clk_sys_clocks^ (in wake mode), because that would prevent the cores from accessing the clocks control registers.

##### 8.1.3.5.2. System sleep mode

###### System sleep mode is entered automatically when both cores are in sleep and the DMA has no outstanding

###### transactions. In system sleep mode, the clock enables described in the previous paragraphs are switched from the

###### WAKE_EN registers to the SLEEP_EN registers. Sleep mode helps reduce power consumed in the clock distribution networks

###### when the chip is inactive. If the user hasn’t configured the WAKE_EN and SLEEP_EN registers, system sleep does nothing.

###### There is little value in using system sleep without taking other measures to reduce power before the cores are put to

###### sleep. Things to consider include:

- Stop unused clock sources such as the PLLs and crystal oscillator.
- Reduce the frequencies of generated clocks by increasing the clock divisors.
- Stop external clocks.

###### For maximum power saving when the chip is inactive, the user should consider DORMANT (see Section 6.5.3,

###### “DORMANT state”) mode in which clocks are sourced from the crystal oscillator and/or the ring oscillator and those

###### clock sources are stopped.

###### For more information about sleep, see Section 6.5.2, “SLEEP state”.

###### 8.1. Overview 521

### 8.1.4. Frequency counter

###### The frequency counter measures the frequency of internal and external clocks by counting the clock edges seen over a

###### test interval. The interval is defined by counting cycles of clk_ref, which must be driven either from XOSC or a stable

###### external source of known frequency.

###### The user can pick between accuracy and test time using the FC0_INTERVAL register. Table 542, “Frequency Counter

###### Test Interval vs Accuracy” shows this trade off:

Table 542. Frequency
Counter Test Interval

###### 0 1 μs 2048kHz

###### 1 2 μs 1024kHz

###### 2 4 μs 512kHz

###### 12 4ms 500Hz

###### 13 8ms 250Hz

###### 14 16ms 125Hz

###### 15 32ms 62.5Hz

### 8.1.5. Resus

###### It is possible to write software that inadvertently stops clk_sys. This normally causes an unrecoverable lock-up of the

###### cores and the on-chip debugger, leaving the user unable to trace the problem. To mitigate against unrecoverable core

###### lock-up, an automatic resuscitation circuit is provided; this switches clk_sys to a known good clock source (clk_ref) if it

###### detects no edges over a user-defined interval. clk_ref can be driven from the XOSC, ROSC or an external source. The

###### interval is programmable via CLK_SYS_RESUS_CTRL.

####  WARNING

###### There is no way for resus to revive the chip if clk_ref is also stopped.

###### To enable the resus:

- Set the timeout interval.
- Set the^ ENABLE^ bit in CLK_SYS_RESUS_CTRL.

###### To detect a resus event:

- Enable the^ CLK_SYS_RESUS^ interrupt by setting the interrupt enable bit in INTE.

###### 8.1. Overview 522

- Enable the^ CLOCKS_DEFAULT_IRQ^ processor interrupt (see Section 3.2, “Interrupts”).

###### Resus is intended as a debugging aid, so the user can trace the software error that triggered the resus, then correct the

###### error and reboot. It is possible to continue running after a resus event by reconfiguring clk_sys, then clearing the resus

```
 (^) WARNING

###### The frequency returned by clock_get_hz will be inaccurate if the provided source frequency is incorrect.

#### 8.1.6.2. Using the frequency counter

###### To use the frequency counter, the programmer must:

###### 1. Set the reference frequency: clk_ref.

###### 2. Set the mux position of the source they want to measure. See FC0_SRC.

###### 3. Wait for the DONE status bit in FC0_STATUS to be set.

###### 4. Read the result.

###### The SDK defines a frequency_count function that takes the source as an argument and returns the frequency in kHz:

```
SDK: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_clocks/clocks.c Lines 147 - 174
147 uint32_t frequency_count_khz(uint src) {
148 fc_hw_t *fc = &clocks_hw->fc0;
149
150 // If frequency counter is running need to wait for it. It runs even if the source is NULL
151 while(fc->status & CLOCKS_FC0_STATUS_RUNNING_BITS) {
152 tight_loop_contents();
153 }
154
155 // Set reference freq
156 fc->ref_khz = clock_get_hz(clk_ref) / 1000;
157
158 // FIXME: Don't pick random interval. Use best interval
159 fc->interval = 10;
160
161 // No min or max
162 fc->min_khz = 0;
163 fc->max_khz = 0xffffffff;
164
165 // Set SRC which automatically starts the measurement
166 fc->src = src;
167
168 while(!(fc->status & CLOCKS_FC0_STATUS_DONE_BITS)) {
169 tight_loop_contents();
170 }
171
172 // Return the result
173 return fc->result >> CLOCKS_FC0_RESULT_KHZ_LSB;
174 }
```
###### 8.1. Overview 526

###### There is also a wrapper function to change the unit to MHz:

```
SDK: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/src/rp2_common/hardware_clocks/include/hardware/clocks.h Lines 377 - 379
377 static inline float frequency_count_mhz(uint src) {
378 return ((float) (frequency_count_khz(src))) / KHZ;
379 }
```
###### The frequency counter can also be used in a test mode. This allows the hardware to check if the frequency is between a

###### minimum and a maximum frequency, set in FC0_MIN_KHZ and FC0_MAX_KHZ. This mode will set one of the following

###### bits in FC0_STATUS when DONE is set:

- SLOW: if the frequency is below the specified range
- PASS: if the frequency is within the specified range
- FAST: if the frequency is above the specified range
- DIED: if the clock is stopped or stops running

###### Test mode will also set the FAIL bit if DIED, FAST, or SLOW are set.

###### The SLEEP_EN registers set what clocks run in sleep mode. The hello_sleep example (hello_sleep_aon.c in the pico-

###### playground GitHub repository) illustrates how to put the chip to sleep until the AON Timer fires.

####  NOTE

###### clk_sys is always sent to proc0 and proc1 during sleep mode, as some logic must be clocked for the processor to

###### wake up again.

## 8.2. Crystal oscillator (XOSC)

### 8.2.1. Overview

###### 8.2. Crystal oscillator (XOSC) 554

Figure 38. The XOSC
is an amplifier. When
a piezoelectric crystal
is connected across
XIN and XOUT, the
amplified feedback
drives the crystal into
mechanical
resonance. This
creates a precise
reference for on-chip
clock generation.
External signals can
also be driven directly
into XIN.

###### The Crystal Oscillator (XOSC) uses an external crystal to produce an accurate reference clock. RP2350 supports 1 MHz

###### to 50 MHz crystals and the RP2350 reference design (see Hardware design with RP2350, Minimal Design Example)

###### uses a 12 MHz crystal. The reference clock is distributed to the PLLs, which can be used to multiply the XOSC frequency

###### to provide accurate high speed clocks. For example, they can generate a 48 MHz clock which meets the frequency

###### accuracy requirement of the USB interface and a 150 MHz maximum speed system clock. The XOSC clock is also a

###### clock source for the clock generators and can be used directly if required.

###### If the user already has an accurate clock source, it is possible to drive an external clock directly into XIN (aka XI), and

###### disable the oscillator circuit. In this mode XIN can be driven at up to 50 MHz.

###### To use XOSC clock externally, output it to a GPIO pin using one of the clk_gpclk0-clk_gpclk3 generators. You cannot take

###### XOSC output directly from the XIN (XI) or XOUT (XO) pins.

 (^) NOTE

###### A minimum crystal frequency of 5 MHz is needed for the PLL. See Section 8.6, “PLL”.

#### 8.2.1.1. Recommended crystals

###### For the best performance and stability across typical operating temperature ranges, it is recommended to use the

###### Abracon ABM8-272-T3. You can source the ABM8-272-T3 directly from Abracon or from an authorised reseller. The

###### Abracon ABM8-272-T3 has the following specifications:

Table 597. Key Crystal
Specifications. Parameters^ Minimum^ Typical^ Maximum^ Units^ Notes

###### Center Frequency 12.000 12.000 12.000 MHz

###### Operation Mode Fundamental-AT Fundamental-AT Fundamental-AT

###### Operating Temperature -40 +85 °C

###### Storage Temperature -55 +125 °C

###### Frequency Tolerance (25 °C) -30 +30 ppm

###### Frequency Stability (25 °C) -30 +30 ppm

###### Equivalent Series Resistance (R1) 50 Ω

###### Shunt Capacitance (C0) 3.0 pF

###### Load Capacitance (CL) 10 10 10 pF

###### Drive Level 10 200 μW

###### Aging -5 +5 ppm @25±3 °C, 1st year

###### Insulation Resistance 500 MΩ @100 Vdc±15 V

###### Even if you use a crystal with similar specifications, you will need to test the circuit over a range of temperatures to

###### 8.2. Crystal oscillator (XOSC) 555

###### ensure stability.

###### The crystal oscillator is powered from the VDDIO voltage. As a result, the Abracon crystal and that particular damping

###### resistor are tuned for 3.3V operation. If you use a different IO voltage, you will need to re-tune.

###### Any changes to crystal parameters risk instability across any components connected to the crystal circuit.

###### If you can’t source the recommended crystal directly from Abracon or a reseller, contact applications@raspberrypi.com.

###### Raspberry Pi Pico 2 has been specifically tuned for the specifications of the Abracon ABM8-272-T3 crystal. For an

###### example of how to use a crystal with RP2350, see the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board schematic in Appendix B of Raspberry

###### Pi Pico 2 Datasheet and the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 design files.

### 8.2.2. Changes from RP2040

- Maximum crystal frequency increased from 15 MHz to 50 MHz, when appropriate range is selected in

###### CTRL.FREQ_RANGE

 (^) NOTE

###### The above change applies when using the XOSC as a crystal oscillator, with a crystal connected between the XIN and

###### XOUT pins. When using the XOSC XIN pin as a CMOS clock input from an external oscillator, the maximum is always

###### 50 MHz. You do not have to configure CTRL.FREQ_RANGE for the CMOS input case. The CMOS input behaviour is

###### the same as RP2040.

####  NOTE

###### The maximum clk_ref frequency is 25 MHz. If you use a >25 MHz crystal as the source of clk_ref, you must divide

###### the XOSC output using the clk_ref divider.

### 8.2.3. Usage

###### The XOSC is disabled on chip startup and RP2350 boots using the Ring Oscillator (ROSC). To start the XOSC, the

###### programmer must set the CTRL_ENABLE register. The XOSC is not immediately usable because it takes time for the

###### oscillations to build to sufficient amplitude. This time will be dependent on the chosen crystal but will be of the order of

###### a few milliseconds. The XOSC incorporates a timer controlled by the STARTUP_DELAY register to automatically manage this,

###### which sets a flag (STATUS_STABLE) when the XOSC clock is usable.

### 8.2.4. Startup delay

###### The STARTUP_DELAY register specifies how many clock cycles must be seen from the crystal before it can be used. This is

###### specified in multiples of 256. The SDK xosc_init function sets this value. The 1 ms default is sufficient for the RP2350

###### reference design (see Hardware design with RP2350, Minimal Design Example) which runs the XOSC at 12 MHz. When

###### the timer expires, the STATUS_STABLE flag will be set to indicate the XOSC output can be used.

###### Before starting the XOSC the programmer must ensure the STARTUP_DELAY register is correctly configured. The required

###### value can be calculated by:

###### So with a 12 MHz crystal and a 1 ms wait time, the calculation is:

###### 8.2. Crystal oscillator (XOSC) 556

####  NOTE

###### The value is rounded up to the nearest integer, so the wait time will be just over 1 ms.

### 8.2.5. XOSC counter

###### The COUNT register provides a method of managing short software delays. To use this method:

###### 1. Write a value to the COUNT register. The register automatically begins to count down to zero at the XOSC frequency.

###### 2. Poll the register until it reaches zero.

###### This is preferable to using NOPs in software loops because it is independent of the core clock frequency, the compiler,

###### and the execution time of the compiled code.

### 8.2.6. DORMANT mode

###### In DORMANT mode (see Section 6.5.3, “DORMANT state”), all of the on-chip clocks can be paused to save power. This

###### is particularly useful in battery-powered applications. RP2350 wakes from DORMANT mode by interrupt: either from an

###### external event, such as an edge on a GPIO pin, or from the AON Timer. This must be configured before entering

###### DORMANT mode. To use the AON Timer to trigger a wake from DORMANT mode, it must be clocked from the LPOSC or

###### from an external source.

###### To enter DORMANT mode:

###### 1. Switch all internal clocks to be driven from XOSC or ROSC and stop the PLLs.

###### 2. Choose an oscillator (XOSC or ROSC). Write a specific 32-bit value to the DORMANT register of the chosen oscillator to

###### stop it.

###### When exiting DORMANT mode, the chosen oscillator will restart. If you chose XOSC, the frequency will be more precise,

###### but the restart will take more time due to startup delay (>1 ms on the RP2350 reference design (see Hardware design

###### with RP2350, Minimal Design Example)). If you chose ROSC, the frequency will be less precise, but the start-up time is

###### very short (approximately 1μs). See Section 6.5.3.1, “Waking from the DORMANT state” for the events which cause the

###### system to exit DORMANT mode.

####  NOTE

###### You must stop the PLLs before entering DORMANT mode.

## 8.3. Ring oscillator (ROSC)

### 8.3.1. Overview

###### The Ring Oscillator (ROSC) is an on-chip oscillator built from a ring of inverters. It requires no external components and

###### is started automatically during RP2350 power up. It provides the clock to the cores during boot. The frequency of the

###### ROSC is programmable and it can directly provide a high speed clock to the cores, but the frequency varies with

###### Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) so it cannot provide clocks for components that require an accurate

###### frequency such as the AON Timer, USB, and ADC. The frequency can be randomised to provide some protection against

###### attempts to recover the system clock from power traces. Methods for mitigating unwanted frequency variation are

###### discussed in Section 8.1, “Overview”, but these are only relevant to very low power designs. For most applications

###### requiring accurate clock frequencies, switch to the XOSC and PLLs. During boot, the ROSC runs at a nominal 11MHz

###### and is guaranteed to be in the range 4.6MHz to 19.6MHz without randomisation and 4.6MHz to 24.0MHz with

###### randomisation.

 (^) NOTE

###### RP2350 A3 and later enable randomisation by default, and the bootrom quadruples the ROSC base frequency by

###### reducing DIV to 2. As a result, clk_sys is guaranteed to range between 18.4 MHz and 96.0 MHz. clk_ref is maintained

###### at a nominal 11 MHz by increasing its divisor. This change increases the sensitivity of the glitch detectors, which

###### have an inverse relationship with clock period, consequently better protecting the ROM’s early boot paths.

###### After the chip has booted, the programmer can choose to continue running from the ROSC and increase its frequency or

###### start the Crystal Oscillator (XOSC) and PLLs. You can disable the ROSC when you’ve switched the system clocks to the

###### XOSC. Each oscillator has advantages; switch between them to achieve the best solution for your application.

###### 8.3. Ring oscillator (ROSC) 561

Figure 39. ROSC
overview.

### 8.3.2. Changes from RP2040

###### Frequency randomisation feature added.

### 8.3.3. Changes between RP2350 revisions

###### RP2350 A3 changes the reset values of FREQA.DS0_RANDOM and FREQA.DS1_RANDOM from 0 to 1. See Hardware

###### changes for information about related changes made to the clock configuration at reset. See Bootrom changes for

###### related changes made in the A3 boot ROM.

### 8.3.4. ROSC/XOSC trade-offs

###### The ROSC has several advantages:

- Flexibility due to programmable frequency
- Low power requirements
- No need for internal or external components
- Optional frequency randomisation improves security

###### Because the ROSC has programmable frequency, it can provide a fast core clock without starting the PLLs and can

###### generate slower peripheral clocks by dividing by clock generators (Section 8.1, “Overview”). The ROSC starts

###### immediately and responds immediately to frequency controls. It retains the frequency setting when entering and exiting

###### the DORMANT state (see Section 6.5.3, “DORMANT state”). However, the user must be aware that the frequency may

###### have drifted when exiting the DORMANT state due to changes in the supply voltage and the chip temperature.

###### The disadvantage of the ROSC is its frequency variation with PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature), which makes it

###### unsuitable for generating precise clocks or for applications where software execution timing is important. However, the

###### PVT frequency variation can be exploited to provide automatic frequency scaling to maximise performance. This is

###### discussed in Section 8.1, “Overview”.

###### The only advantage of the XOSC is its accurate frequency, but this is an overriding requirement in many applications.

###### The XOSC has the following disadvantages:

- the requirement for external components (a crystal, etc.)
- higher power consumption
- slow startup time (>1ms)
- fixed, low frequency

###### PLLs are required to produce higher-frequency clocks. They consume more power and take significant time to start up

###### or change frequency. Exiting DORMANT mode is much slower than for ROSC because the XOSC must restart and the

###### PLLs must be reconfigured.

###### 8.3. Ring oscillator (ROSC) 562

### 8.3.5. Modifying the frequency

###### The ROSC is arranged as 8 stages, each with programmable drive. The ROSC provides two methods of controlling the

###### frequency. The frequency range controls the number of stages in the ROSC loop and the FREQA & FREQB registers control

###### the drive strength of the stages.

###### To change the frequency range, write to the FREQ_RANGE register, which controls the number of stages in the ROSC loop.

###### The FREQ_RANGE register supports the following configurations:

Table 604. ROSC
stage ranges Name^ Number of stages^ Range (stages)

###### LOW 8 0-7

###### MEDIUM 6 2-7

###### HIGH 4 4-7

###### TOOHIGH 2 6-7

###### Change FREQ_RANGE one step at a time until you reach the desired range. When increasing the frequency range, ROSC

###### output will not glitch, so the output clock can continue to be used. When decreasing the frequency range, ROSC output

###### will glitch, so you must select an alternate clock source for the modules clocked by ROSC or hold them in reset during

###### the transition.

###### The behaviour has not been fully characterised, but the MEDIUM range will be approximately 1.33 times the LOW range, the

###### HIGH range will be 2 times the LOW range and the TOOHIGH range will be 4 times the LOW range. The TOOHIGH range is aptly

###### named. It should not be used because the internal logic of the ROSC will not run at that frequency.

###### The FREQA and FREQB registers control the drive strength of the stages in the ROSC loop. As the drive strength increases,

###### the delay through the stage decreases and the oscillation frequency increases. Each stage has 3 drive strength control

###### bits. Each bit turns on an additional drive, therefore each stage has 4 drive strength settings equal to the number of bits

###### set, with 0 being the default, 1 being double drive, 2 being triple drive and 3 being quadruple drive. Extra drives do not

###### have a linear effect on frequency: the second has less impact than the first, the third has less impact than the second,

###### and so on. To ensure smooth transitions, change one drive strength bit at a time. When FREQ_RANGE shortens the ROSC

###### loop, the bypassed stages still propagate the signal and therefore their drive strengths must be set to at least the same

###### level as the lowest drive strength in the stages that are in the loop. This will not affect the oscillation frequency.

### 8.3.6. Randomising the frequency

###### Randomisation is enabled by setting the drive strength controls for the first two stages of the ROSC loop to DS0_RANDOM

###### and DS1_RANDOM. An LFSR then provides the drive strength controls for those two stages which are always included in the

###### loop regardless of the FREQ_RANGE setting. It is recommended to randomise both stages. When the low FREQ_RANGE is

###### selected the randomiser will increase the frequency by up to 22% of the default. The increase will be approximately half

###### of that if only one stage is randomised. The LFSR can be seeded by writing to the RANDOM register. This can be done at

###### any time but will restart the randomiser.

### 8.3.7. ROSC divider

###### The ROSC frequency is too fast to be used directly, so it is divided in an integer divider controlled by the DIV register. You

###### can change DIV while the ROSC is running, and the output clock will change frequency without glitching. The default

###### divisor is 8, which ensures the output clock is in the specified range on chip startup.

###### The divider has two outputs, rosc_clksrc and rosc_clksrc_ph. rosc_clksrc_ph is a phase shifted version of rosc_clksrc. This

###### is primarily intended for use during product development; the outputs are identical if the PHASE register is left in its

###### default state.

###### 8.3. Ring oscillator (ROSC) 563

### 8.3.8. Random number generator

###### When the system clocks are running from the XOSC, you can use the ROSC to generate random numbers. Enable the

###### ROSC and read the RANDOMBIT register to get a 1-bit random number; to get an n-bit value, read it n times. This does not

###### meet the requirements of randomness for security systems because it can be compromised, but it may be useful in less

###### critical applications. If the cores are running from the ROSC, the value will not be random because the timing of the

###### register read will be correlated to the phase of the ROSC.

### 8.3.9. ROSC counter

###### The COUNT register provides a method of managing short software delays. To use this method:

###### 1. Write a value to the COUNT register. The register automatically begins to count down to zero at the ROSC frequency.

###### 2. Poll the register until it reaches zero.

###### This is preferable to using NOPs in software loops because it is independent of the core clock frequency, the compiler,

###### and the execution time of the compiled code.

### 8.3.10. DORMANT mode

###### In DORMANT mode (see Section 6.5.3, “DORMANT state”), all of the on-chip clocks can be paused to save power. This

###### is particularly useful in battery-powered applications. RP2350 wakes from DORMANT mode by interrupt: either from an

###### external event, such as an edge on a GPIO pin, or from the AON Timer. This must be configured before entering

###### DORMANT mode. To use the AON Timer to trigger a wake from DORMANT mode, it must be clocked from the LPOSC or

###### from an external source.

###### To enter DORMANT mode:

###### 1. Switch all internal clocks to be driven from XOSC or ROSC and stop the PLLs.

###### 2. Choose an oscillator (XOSC or ROSC). Write a specific 32-bit value to the DORMANT register of the chosen oscillator to

###### stop it.

###### When exiting DORMANT mode, the chosen oscillator will restart. If you chose XOSC, the frequency will be more precise,

###### but the restart will take more time due to startup delay (>1ms on the RP2350 reference design (see Hardware design

###### with RP2350, Minimal Design Example)). If you chose ROSC, the frequency will be less precise, but the start-up time is

###### very short (approximately 1μs). See Section 6.5.3.1, “Waking from the DORMANT state” for the events which cause the

###### system to exit DORMANT mode.

####  NOTE

###### You must stop the PLLs before entering DORMANT mode.

## 8.4. Low Power oscillator (LPOSC)

###### The Low Power Oscillator (LPOSC) provides a clock signal to the always-on logic when the main crystal oscillator is

###### powered down in a low power (P1.x) state. It operates at a nominal 32.768kHz and is an RC oscillator, requiring no

###### external components. The oscillator’s output clock is used to sequence initial chip start up and transition to and from

###### low-power states. It can also be used by the AON Timer, see Section 12.10, “Always-on timer”.

###### The oscillator starts up as soon as the core power supply is available and power-on reset has been released. If

###### brownout detection is enabled, the oscillator will be disabled when a core supply brownout is detected, but will restart

###### as soon as the core supply has recovered and brownout reset has been released. The oscillator’s frequency takes

###### around 1ms to stabilise, and the chip will be held in reset during this period.

### 8.4.1. Frequency accuracy and calibration

###### The low power oscillator has an initial frequency accuracy of ±20%. However, it can be trimmed to ±1.5% using the TRIM

###### field in the LPOSC register. 63 trim steps are available, each between 1% and 3% of the oscillator’s initial frequency. The

###### frequency can be trimmed down by 32 steps or up by 31 steps. See Table 616, “low power oscillator output frequency

###### and trimming” and Section 8.4.3, “List of registers” for details.

###### Frequency drift with power supply voltage: ±20%.

### 8.4.2. Using an external low-power clock

###### Instead of using the low-power RC oscillator, an external 32.768 kHz low power clock signal can be provided on one of

###### GPIO 12, 14, 20, or 22. Alternatively, those GPIOs can be used to provide a 1 kHz or 1 Hz tick. See Section 12.10.5.2,

###### details.

### 8.4.3. List of registers

###### The low power oscillator shares register address space with other power management subsystems in the always-on

###### domain. The address space is referred to as POWMAN elsewhere in this document. A complete list of POWMAN

###### registers is provided in Section 6.4, “Power management (POWMAN) registers”, but information on registers associated

###### with the low power oscillator is repeated here.

###### The POWMAN registers start at a base address of 0x40100000 (defined as POWMAN_BASE in SDK).

## 8.5. Tick generators

### 8.5.1. Overview

###### The tick generators provide time references for several blocks:

- System timers: TIMER0 and TIMER1 (Section 12.8, “System timers”)
- RISC-V platform timer (Section 3.1.8, “RISC-V platform timer”)
- Arm Cortex-M33 SysTick timers for core 0 and core 1
- The watchdog timer (Section 12.9, “Watchdog”)

###### A tick is a periodic signal which provides a timebase for a timer or counter. These signals are similar to clocks, although

###### they do not drive the clock inputs of any registers on the chip. The use of ticks as opposed to clocks makes it simpler to

###### distribute timebase information that is independent of any subsystem clocks. For example, the system timers (TIMER0

###### and TIMER1) should continue to count once per microsecond even as the system clock varies according to processor

###### demand.

###### The tick generators use clk_ref as their reference clock (see Section 8.1, “Overview” for an overview of system-level

###### clocks including clk_ref). Ideally, clk_ref will be configured to use the crystal oscillator (Section 8.2, “Crystal oscillator

###### (XOSC)”) to provide an accurate reference. The generators divide clk_ref internally to generate a tick signal for each

###### destination.

###### The SDK expects a nominal 1 μs timebase for the system timers and the RISC-V platform timer. Similarly the Cortex-

###### M33 SysTick timers require a 1 μs timebase to match the hardwired value of 100,000 in the SYST_CALIB register, which

###### standard Arm software uses to scale SysTick delays. However, you may need to scale these timebases differently if

###### your software has specific requirements such as a longer maximum delay on the 24-bit SysTick peripherals. The tick

###### generator can scale each destination’s tick timebase independently of the others.

###### For a 12 MHz reference clock, set the cycle count to 12 to generate a 1 μs tick. A 1 MHz clock has a period of 1 μs, so

###### 8.5. Tick generators 570

###### the hardware needs to count for 12 times as many clock cycles to get a 1 μs tick from a reference running at 12 ×

###### 1 MHz.

###### Before changing the cycle count, always stop the tick generator with the TIMER0_CTRL.ENABLE bit. You can re-enable

###### once the tick generator is configured.

### 8.5.2. List of registers

###### The tick generator registers start at a base address of 0x40108000 (defined as TICKS_BASE in SDK).

## 8.6. PLL

### 8.6.1. Overview

###### The PLL takes a reference clock and multiplies it using a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) with a feedback loop. The

###### VCO runs at high frequencies: between 750 MHz and 1600 MHz. As a result, there are two post dividers that can divide

###### the VCO frequency before it is distributed to the clock generators on the chip.

###### There are two PLLs in RP2350. They are:

- pll_sys^ - used to generate up to a 150 MHz system clock
- pll_usb^ - used to generate a 48 MHz USB reference clock

Figure 40. On both
PLLs, the FREF
(reference) input is
connected to the
crystal oscillator’s XIN
(XI) input. The PLL
contains a VCO, which
is locked to a constant
ratio of the reference
clock via the feedback
loop (phase-frequency
detector and loop
filter). This can
synthesise very high
frequencies, which
may be divided down
by the post-dividers.

###### The routing between PLLs and system-level clocks is flexible. For example, you could run USB off a division of the

###### system PLL (e.g. 144 MHz / 3 = 48 MHz), leaving the USB PLL free for other uses such as the HSTX peripheral or a

###### general-purpose clock output on a GPIO.

### 8.6.2. Changes from RP2040

- RP2350 added an interrupt that fires if the PLL loses lock. See CS.LOCK_N.

###### 8.6. PLL 575

### 8.6.3. Calculating PLL parameters

###### To configure the PLL, you must know the frequency of the reference clock, which is routed directly from the crystal

###### oscillator. This will often be a 12 MHz crystal, for compatibility with RP2350’s USB bootrom. The PLL’s final output

###### frequency FOUTPOSTDIV can then be calculated as (FREF / REFDIV) × FBDIV / (POSTDIV1 × POSTDIV2). With a desired output

###### frequency in mind, you must select PLL parameters according to the following constraints of the PLL design:

- minimum reference frequency (FREF^ /^ REFDIV) is 5 MHz
- oscillator frequency (FOUTVCO) must be in the range 750 MHz-1600 MHz
- feedback divider (FBDIV) must be in the range 16-320
- the post dividers^ POSTDIV1^ and^ POSTDIV2^ must be in the range 1-7
- maximum input frequency (FREF^ /^ REFDIV) is VCO frequency divided by 16, due to minimum feedback divisor

###### You must also respect the maximum frequencies of the chip’s clock generators (attached to FOUTPOSTDIV). For the

###### system PLL this is 150 MHz, and for the USB PLL, 48 MHz. If using a crystal oscillator with a frequency of less than

###### 75 MHz, REFDIV should be 1 assuming a VCO of 1200 MHz-1600 MHz. If using a fast crystal with a low VCO frequency,

###### the reference divisor may need to be increased to keep the PLL input within a suitable range.

####  TIP

###### When two different values are required for POSTDIV1 and POSTDIV2, assign the higher value to POSTDIV1 for lower power

###### consumption.

###### In the RP2350 reference design (see Hardware design with RP2350, Minimal Design Example), which attaches a 12 MHz

###### crystal to the crystal oscillator, the minimum VCO frequency is 12 MHz × 63 = 756 MHz, and the maximum VCO

###### frequency is 12 MHz × 133 = 1596 MHz. As a result, FBDIV must remain in the range 63 to 133 to avoid leaving the

###### supported range of VCO frequencies. Setting FBDIV to 100 would synthesise a 1200 MHz VCO frequency. A POSTDIV1

###### value of 6 and a POSTDIV2 value of 2 would divide this by 12 in total, producing a clean 100 MHz at the PLL’s final output.

#### 8.6.3.1. Jitter versus power consumption

###### Often, several sets of PLL configuration parameters achieve the desired output frequency (or a close approximation).

###### You decide whether to prioritise lower power consumption or lower jitter: cycle-to-cycle variation in the PLL’s output

###### clock period. Jitter decreases as VCO frequency increases, because you can use higher post-divide values. Consider the

###### following scenarios:

- 1500 MHz VCO / 6 / 2 = 125 MHz
- 750 MHz VCO / 6 / 1 = 125 MHz

###### The 1500 MHz configuration uses the most power, but produces the least jitter. The 750 MHz configuration uses the

###### least power, but produces the most jitter.

###### You can slightly adjust the desired output frequency to allow for a much lower VCO frequency by bringing the output to

###### a closer rational multiple of the input. Some frequencies are not be achievable at all with a possible VCO frequency and

###### combination of divisors.

###### Because RP2350’s digital logic compensates for the worst possible jitter on the system clock, this doesn’t affect

###### system stability. However, applications often require a highly accurate clock for data transfers that follow the USB

###### specification, which defines a maximum amount of allowable jitter.

#### 8.6.3.2. Calculating parameters with vcocalc.py

###### SDK provides a Python script that searches for the best VCO and post divider options for a desired output frequency:

###### 8.6. PLL 576

###### Given an input and output frequency, this script finds the best possible set of PLL parameters. When the script finds

###### multiple equally good combinations, it returns the parameters which yield the highest VCO frequency, for the best

###### --vco-max flag to limit the maximum VCO frequency. If the script cannot find an exact match given the provided

###### constraints, it outputs the closest reasonable match instead.

###### The following example uses the script to request a 48 MHz output with the best output stability:

```
$ ./vcocalc.py 48
Requested: 48.0 MHz
Achieved: 48.0 MHz
REFDIV: 1
FBDIV: 120 (VCO = 1440.0 MHz)
PD1: 6
PD2: 5
```
###### This can also be output as CMake for configuring an SDK application:

###### 8.6. PLL 578

```
$ ./vcocalc.py 48 --cmake
Requested: 48.0 MHz
Achieved: 48.0 MHz
REFDIV: 1
FBDIV: 120 (VCO = 1440.0 MHz)

PLL_SYS_REFDIV=1
PLL_SYS_VCO_FREQ_HZ=1440000000
PLL_SYS_POSTDIV1=6
PLL_SYS_POSTDIV2=5
)
```
###### You can also pass --cmake-only to get just the CMake output, and --cmake-executable-name to replace the <program> with the

###### name of the target program you are configuring.

###### The following example uses the script to request a 48 MHz output with the lowest power consumption:

```
$ ./vcocalc.py -l 48
Requested: 48.0 MHz
Achieved: 48.0 MHz
REFDIV: 1
FBDIV: 64 (VCO = 768.0 MHz)
PD1: 4
PD2: 4
```
###### The following example uses the script to request a 125 MHz output with the lowest power consumption, with the

###### reference divisor REFDIV fixed at a value of 1. Even though we stated a preference for slower VCO frequencies, the

###### resulting frequency remains quite high:

```
$ ./vcocalc.py -l 125 --lock-refdiv=1
Requested: 125.0 MHz
Achieved: 125.0 MHz
REFDIV: 1
FBDIV: 125 (VCO = 1500.0 MHz)
PD1: 6
PD2: 2
```
###### This happens when the best match for your requested output requires a high VCO frequency. The script always returns

###### the best match, preferring lower VCO frequencies only when there are multiple, equally good matches.

###### You can work around this by restricting the upper VCO frequency. The following example uses the script to request a

###### 125 MHz system clock, restricting the search to VCO frequencies below 800 MHz. There is no exact match, so the script

###### considers near (but not exact) frequency matches. Relaxing the search to allow nearby non-exact matches significantly

###### reduces the minimum VCO frequency compared to the previous example:

```
$ ./vcocalc.py -l 125 --lock-refdiv=1 --vco-max=800
Locking REFDIV to 1
Requested: 125.0 MHz
Achieved: 126.0 MHz
REFDIV: 1
FBDIV: 63 (VCO = 756.0 MHz)
PD1: 6
```
###### 8.6. PLL 579

PD2: 1

###### A 126 MHz system clock may be a tolerable deviation from the desired 125 MHz, and generating this clock consumes

###### less power at the PLL.

###### By default the script also searches reference divisors, which may give a closer match to your requested output, or

###### enable higher or lower VCO frequencies (depending on preference). The following example allows the script to search

###### FBDIV values:

```
$ ./vcocalc.py -l 125
Requested: 125.0 MHz
Achieved: 125.0 MHz
REFDIV: 2
FBDIV: 125 (VCO = 750.0 MHz)
PD1: 6
PD2: 1
This requires a non-default REFDIV value.
Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt to apply the REFDIV:
target_compile_definitions(<program> PRIVATE
PLL_SYS_REFDIV=2
PLL_SYS_VCO_FREQ_HZ=750000000
PLL_SYS_POSTDIV1=6
PLL_SYS_POSTDIV2=1
)
```
###### This finds a solution with exactly the requested output, at exactly the minimum VCO frequency of 750 MHz.

###### All of the above assume a 12 MHz crystal. RP2350 supports a range of XOSC frequencies documented in Section 8.2,

###### “Crystal oscillator (XOSC)”. Suppose we had a 32 MHz crystal, and required a 150 MHz system clock, the maximum

###### supported on RP2350. You can specify the input frequency with the --input or -i flag, as shown in the following

###### example:

```
$./vcocalc.py 150 -i 32
Requested: 150.0 MHz
Achieved: 150.0 MHz
REFDIV: 2
FBDIV: 75 (VCO = 1200.0 MHz)
PD1: 4
PD2: 2
This requires a non-default REFDIV value.
Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt to apply the REFDIV:
target_compile_definitions(<program> PRIVATE
PLL_SYS_REFDIV=2
PLL_SYS_VCO_FREQ_HZ=1200000000

145 // 2. The 'USB PLL' generates the USB clock, the frequency is defined by `USB_CLK_KHZ`.
146 //
147 // The two PLLs use the crystal oscillator output directly as their reference frequency input;
the PLLs reference
148 // frequency cannot be reduced by the dividers present in the clocks block. The crystal
frequency is defined by `XOSC_HZ` (or
149 // `XOSC_KHZ` or `XOSC_MHZ`).
150 //
151 // The system's default definitions are correct for the above frequencies with a 12MHz
152 // crystal frequency. If different frequencies are required, these must be defined in
153 // the board configuration file together with the revised PLL settings
154 // Use `vcocalc.py` to check and calculate new PLL settings if you change any of these
frequencies.
155 //
156 // Default PLL configuration RP2040:
157 // REF FBDIV VCO POSTDIV
158 // PLL SYS: 12 / 1 = 12MHz * 125 = 1500MHz / 6 / 2 = 125MHz
159 // PLL USB: 12 / 1 = 12MHz * 100 = 1200MHz / 5 / 5 = 48MHz
160 //
161 // Default PLL configuration RP2350:
162 // REF FBDIV VCO POSTDIV
163 // PLL SYS: 12 / 1 = 12MHz * 125 = 1500MHz / 5 / 2 = 150MHz
164 // PLL USB: 12 / 1 = 12MHz * 100 = 1200MHz / 5 / 5 = 48MHz

###### The programming sequence for the PLL is as follows:

###### 1. Program the reference clock divider (is a divide by 1 in the RP2350 case).

###### 2. Program the feedback divider.

###### 3. Turn on the main power and VCO.

###### 4. Wait for the VCO to achieve a stable frequency, as indicated by the LOCK status flag.

###### 5. Set up post dividers and turn them on.
