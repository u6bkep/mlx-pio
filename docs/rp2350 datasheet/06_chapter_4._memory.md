# Chapter 4. Memory

```
RP2350 has embedded ROM, OTP and SRAM. RP2350 provides access to external flash via a QSPI interface.
```
## 4.1. ROM

```
A 32 kB read-only memory (ROM) appears at address 0x00000000. The ROM contents are fixed permanently at the time
the silicon is manufactured. Chapter 5 describes the ROM contents in detail, but in summary it contains:
```
## • Core 0 Boot code (Section 5.2)

## • Core 1 Launch code (Section 5.3)

## • Runtime APIs (Section 5.4).

## • USB bootloader

## ◦ Mass storage interface for drag and drop of UF2 flash and SRAM binaries (Section 5.5)

## ◦ PICOBOOT interface to support^ picotool^ and advanced operations like OTP programming (Section 5.6)

## ◦ Support for white-labelling all USB exposed information/identifiers (Section 5.7)

## • UART bootloader: minimal shell to load an SRAM binary from a host microcontroller (Section 5.8)

```
The ROM offers single-cycle access, and has a dedicated AHB5 arbiter, so it can be accessed simultaneously with other
memory devices. Writing to the ROM has no effect, and no bus fault is generated on write.
The ROM is covered by IDAU regions enumerated in Section 10.2.2. These aid in partitioning the bootrom between
Secure and Non-secure code: in particular the USB/UART bootloader runs as a Non-secure client application on Arm, to
reduce the attack surface of the secure boot implementation.
Certain ROM features are not implemented on RISC-V, most notably secure boot.
```
## 4.2. SRAM

```
There is a total of 520 kB (520 × 1024 bytes) of on-chip SRAM. For performance reasons, this memory is physically
partitioned into ten banks, but logically it still behaves as a single, flat 520 kB memory. RP2350 does not restrict the
data stored in each bank: you can use any bank to store processor code, data buffers, or a mixture of the two. There are
eight 16,384 × 32-bit banks (64 kB each) and two 1024 × 32-bit banks (4 kB each).
```
 (^) NOTE
Banking is a physical partitioning of SRAM which improves performance by allowing multiple simultaneous
accesses. Logically, there is a single 520 kB contiguous memory.
Each SRAM bank is accessed via a dedicated AHB5 arbiter. This means different bus managers can access different
SRAM banks in parallel, so up to six 32-bit SRAM accesses can take place every system clock cycle (one per manager).
SRAM is mapped to system addresses starting at 0x20000000. The first 256 kB address region, up to and including
0x2003ffff, is word-striped across the first four 64 kB banks. The next 256 kB address region, up to 0x2007ffff is word-
striped across the remaining four 64 kB banks. The watermark between these two striped regions, at 0x20040000, marks
the boundary between the SRAM0 and SRAM1 power domains.
Consecutive words in the system address space are routed to different RAM banks as shown in Table 434. This scheme
is referred to as sequential interleaving, and improves bus parallelism for typical memory access patterns.

```
```

0x2000002c Bank 3 2
```
```
etc
```
```
The top two 4 kB regions (starting at 0x20080000 and 0x20081000) map directly to the smaller 4 kB memory banks.
Software may choose to use these for per-core purposes (e.g. stack and frequently-executed code), guaranteeing that
the processors never stall on these accesses. Like all SRAM on RP2350, these banks have single-cycle access from all
managers, (provided no other managers access the bank in the same cycle) so it is reasonable to treat memory as a
single 520 kB device.
```
 (^) NOTE
RP2040 had a non-striped SRAM mirror. RP2350 no longer has a non-striped mirror, to avoid mapping the same
SRAM location as both Secure and Non-secure. You can still achieve some explicit bandwidth partitioning by
allocating data across two 256 kB blocks of 4-way-striped SRAM.

#### 4.2.1. Other on-chip memory

```
Besides the 520 kB main memory, there are two other dedicated RAM blocks that may be used in some circumstances:
```
- Cache lines can be individually pinned within the XIP address space for use as SRAM, up to the total cache size of
    16 kB (see Section 4.4.1.3). Unpinned cache lines remain available for transparent caching of XIP accesses.
- If USB is not used, the USB data DPRAM can be used as a 4 kB memory starting at^ 0x50100000.
There is also 1 kB of dedicated boot RAM, hardwired to Secure access only, whose contents and layout is defined by the
bootrom — see Chapter 5.

4.2. SRAM 338

#####  NOTE

```
Memory in the peripheral address space (addresses starting with 0x4, 0x5 or 0xd) does not support code execution.
This includes USB RAM and boot RAM. These address ranges are made IDAU-Exempt to simplify assigning
peripherals to security domains using ACCESSCTRL, and consequently must be made non-executable to avoid the
possibility of Non-secure-writable, Secure-executable memory.
```
## 4.3. Boot RAM

```
Boot RAM is a 1 kB (256 × 32-bit) SRAM dedicated for use by the bootrom. It is slower than main SRAM, as it is
accessed over APB, taking three cycles for a read and four cycles for a write.
```
```
Boot RAM is used for myriad purposes during boot, including the initial pre-boot stack. After the bootrom enters the
user application, boot RAM contains state for the user-facing ROM APIs, such as the resident partition table used for
flash programming protection, and a copy of the flash XIP setup function (formerly known as boot2) to quickly re-
initialise flash XIP modes following serial programming operations.
Boot RAM is hardwired to permit Secure access only (Arm) or Machine-mode access only (RISC-V). It is physically
impossible to execute code from boot RAM, regardless of MPU configuration, as it is on the APB peripheral bus
segment, which is not wired to the processor instruction fetch ports.
Since boot RAM is in the XIP RAM power domain, it is always powered when the switched core domain is powered. This
simplifies SRAM power management in the bootrom, because it doesn’t have to power up any RAM before it has a place
to store the call stack.
```
```
Boot RAM supports the standard atomic set/clear/XOR accesses used by other peripherals on RP2350 (Section 2.1.3).
It is possible to use boot RAM for user-defined purposes, but this is not recommended, as it may cause ROM APIs to
behave unpredictably. Calling into the ROM could modify data stored in boot RAM.
```
#### 4.3.1. List of registers

```
A small number of registers are located on the same bus endpoint as boot RAM:
```
```
Write Once Bits
These are flags which once set, can only be cleared by a system reset. They are used in the implementation of
certain bootrom security features.
```
```
Boot Locks
These function the same as the SIO spinlocks (Section 3.1.4), however they are normally reserved for bootrom
purposes (Section 5.4.4).
These registers start from an offset of 0x800 above the boot RAM base address of 0x400e0000 (defined as
BOOTRAM_BASE in the SDK).

## 4.4. External flash and PSRAM (XIP)

```
RP2350 can access external flash and PSRAM via its execute-in-place (XIP) subsystem. The term execute-in-place
refers to external memory mapped directly into the chip’s internal address space. This enables you to execute code as-
```
```
is from the external memory without explicitly copying into on-chip SRAM. For example, a processor instruction fetch
from AHB address 0x10001234 results in a QSPI memory interface fetch from address 0x001234 in an external flash device.
A 16 kB on-chip cache retains the values of recent reads and writes. This reduces the chances that XIP bus accesses
must go to external memory, improving the average throughput and latency of the XIP interface. The cache is physically
structured as two 8 kB banks, interleaving odd and even cache lines of 8-byte granularity over the two banks. This
allows processors to access multiple cache lines during the same cycle. Logically, the XIP cache behaves as a single
16 kB cache.

QMI generates an
external serial access,
adds the resulting
data to the cache, and
forwards it on to the
system bus (for reads)
or merges it with the
AHB write data (for
writes).

```
When booting from flash, the RP2350 bootrom (Chapter 5) sets up a baseline QMI execute-in-place configuration. User
code may later reconfigure this to improve performance for a specific flash device. QSPI clock divisors can be changed
at any time, including whilst executing from XIP. Other reconfiguration requires a momentary disable of the interface.
```
#### 4.4.1. XIP cache

```
The cache is 16 kB, two-way set-associative, 1 cycle hit. It is internal to the XIP subsystem, and only involved in
accesses to the QSPI memory interface, so software does not have to consider cache coherence unless performing
flash programming operations. It caches accesses to a 26-bit downstream XIP address space. On RP2350, the lower
half of this space is occupied by two 16 MB windows for the two QMI chip selects. RP2350 reserves the remainder for
future expansion, but you can use the space to pin cache lines outside of the QMI address space for use as cache-as-
SRAM (Section 4.4.1.3). The 26-bit XIP address space is mirrored multiple times in the RP2350 address space, decoded
on bits 27:26 of the system bus address:
```
- 0x10... : Cached XIP access
- 0x14... : Uncached XIP access
- 0x18... : Cache maintenance writes
- 0x1c... : Uncached, untranslated XIP access^ —^ bypass QMI address translation
You can disable cache lookup separately for Secure and Non-secure accesses via the CTRL.EN_SECURE and
CTRL.EN_NONSECURE register bits. The CTRL register contains controls to disable Secure/Non-secure access to the
uncached and uncached/untranslated XIP windows, which avoids duplicate mappings that may otherwise require
additional SAU or PMP regions.

##### 4.4.1.1. Cache maintenance

Cache maintenance is performed on a line-by-line basis by writing into the cache maintenance mirror of the XIP address
space, starting at 0x18000000. Cache lines are 8 bytes in size. Write data is ignored; instead, the 3 LSBs of the address
select the maintenance operation:

- 0x0: Invalidate by set/way
- 0x1: Clean by set/way
- 0x2: Invalidate by address
- 0x3: Clean by address
- 0x7: Pin cache set/way at address (Section 4.4.1.3)
    Invalidate
       Marks a cache line as no longer containing data; the next access to the same address will miss the cache.
       Does not write back any data to external memory. Used when external memory has been modified in a way
       that the cache would not automatically know about, such as a flash programming operation.

```
Clean
Instructs the cache to write out any data stored in the cache as a result of a previous cached write access that
has not yet been written out to external memory. Used to make cached writes available to uncached reads.
Also used when cache contents are about to be lost, but external memory is to stay powered (for example,
when the system is about to power down).
```
By set/way
Selects a particular cache line to be maintained, out of the 2048 × 8-byte lines that make up the cache. Bit 13 of
the system bus address selects the cache way. Bits 12:3 of the address select a particular cache line within
that way. Mainly used to iterate exhaustively over all cache lines (for example, during a full cache flush).
By address
Looks up an address in the cache, then performs the requested maintenance if that line is currently allocated
in the cache. Used when only a particular range of XIP addresses needs to be maintained, for example, a flash
page that was just programmed. Usually faster than a full flush, because the real cost of a cache flush is not in
the maintenance operations, but the large number of subsequent cache misses.
Pin
Prevents a particular cache line from being evicted. Used to mark important external memory contents that
must get guaranteed cache hits, or to allocate cache lines for use as cache-as-SRAM. If a cached access to
some other address misses the cache and attempts to evict a pinned cache line, the eviction fails, and the
access is downgraded to an uncached access.
Cache maintenance operations operate on the cache’s tag memory. This is the cache’s metadata store, which tracks
the state of each cache line. Maintenance operations do not affect the cache’s data memory, which contains the
cache’s copy of data bytes from external memory.

By default, cache maintenance is Secure-only. Non-secure writes to the cache maintenance address window have no
effect and return a bus error. Non-secure cache maintenance can be enabled by setting the CTRL.MAINT_NONSEC
register bit, but this is not recommended if Secure software may perform cached XIP accesses.

##### 4.4.1.2. Cache line states

The changes to a cache line caused by cached accesses and maintenance operations can be summarised by a set of
state transitions.

###### Invalid

Pinned (^) Dirty

###### Clean

###### Inv, Evict

###### Inv, Clean R

###### R

###### R, W, Clean, Pin R, W

###### Clean W

###### W

###### Inv Pin

###### Inv, Evict

###### Pin

###### Pin

transition diagram for
each cache line. Inv,
Clean and Pin

maintenance
operations,
respectively. R and W
represent cached
reads and writes. Evict
represents a cache
line deallocation to
make room for a new
allocation due to a
read/write cache
miss.

```
Initially, the state of all cache lines is undefined. When booting from flash, the bootrom performs an invalidate by
set/way on every line of the cache to force them to a known state. In the diagram above, all states have an Inv arc to the
invalid state.
```
```
A dirty cache line contains data not yet propagated to downstream memory.
A clean cache line contains data that matches the downstream memory contents.
```
```
Accessing an invalid cache line causes an allocation: the cache fetches the corresponding data from downstream
memory, stores it in the cache, then marks the cache line as clean or dirty. The cache also stores part of the
downstream address, known as the tag, to recall the downstream address stored in each cache line. Read allocations
enter the clean state, so the cache line can be safely freed at any time. Write allocations enter the dirty state, so the
cache line must propagate downstream before it can be freed.
```
```
Writing to a clean cache line marks it as dirty because the cache now contains write data that has not propagated
downstream. The line can be explicitly returned to the clean state using a clean maintenance operation (0x1 or 0x3), but
this is not required. Typically, the cache automatically propagates dirty cache lines downstream when it needs to
reallocate them.
Evictions happen when a cached read or write needs to allocate a cache line that is already in the clean or dirty state.
The eviction transitions the line momentarily to the invalid state, ready for allocation. For clean cache lines, this happens
instantaneously. For dirty cache lines, the cache must first propagate the cache line contents downstream before it can
safely enter the invalid state.
```
```
Cache lines enter the pinned state using a pin maintenance operation (0x7) and exit only by an invalidate maintenance
operation (0x0 or 0x2).
```
#####  NOTE

```
The pin maintenance operation only marks the line as pinned; it does not perform any copying of data. When pinning
lines that exist in external memory devices, you must first pin the line, then copy the downstream data into the
pinned line by reading from the uncached XIP window.
```
##### 4.4.1.3. Cache-as-SRAM

When you disabled the cache of RP2040, the cache would map the entire cache memory at 0x15000000. RP2350 replaces
this with the ability to pin individual cache lines. You can use this in the following ways:

- Pin the entire cache at some address range to use the entire cache as SRAM
- Pin one full cache way to make half of the cache available for cache-as-SRAM use (the remaining cache way still
    functions as usual)
- Pin an address range that that maps critical flash contents

#####  NOTE

```
Pinned cache lines are not accessible when the cache is disabled via the CTRL register (CTRL.EN_SECURE or
CTRL.EN_NONSECURE depending on security level of the bus access).
```
Because the QMI only occupies the lower half of the 64 MB XIP address space, you can pin cache lines outside of the
QMI address range (e.g. at the top of the XIP space) to avoid interfering with any QMI accesses. As a general rule, the
more cache you pin, the lower the cache hit rate for other accesses.

Cache lines are pinned using the pin maintenance operation (0x7), which performs the following steps:

1. An implicit invalidate-by-address operation (0x2) using the full address of the maintenance operation

### ◦ This ensures that each address is allocated in only one cache way (required for correct cache operation)

2. Select the cache line to be pinned, using bit 13 to select the cache way, and bits 12:3 to select the cache set (as
    with 0x0/0x1 invalidate/clean by set/way commands)
3. Write the address to the cache line’s tag entry
4. Change the cache line’s state to pinned (as per the state diagram in Section 4.4.1.2)
5. Update the cache line’s tag with the full address of the maintenance operation

After a pin operation, cached reads and writes to the specified address always hit the cache until that cache line is
either invalidated or pinned to a different address.

#####  NOTE

```
Pinning two addresses that are equal modulo cache size pins the same cache line twice. It does not pin two different
cache lines. The second pin will overwrite the first.
```
When a cached access hits a pinned cache line, it behaves the same as a dirty line. The cache reads and writes as if
allocated in the cache by normal means.

Cache eviction policy is random, and the cache only makes one attempt to select an eviction way. If the cache selects
to evict a pinned line, the eviction fails, and the access is demoted to an uncached access. As a result, a cache with one
way pinned does not behave exactly the same as a direct-mapped 8 kB cache, but average-case performance is similar.

Cache line states are stored in the cache tag memory stored in the XIP memory power domain. This memory contents
do not change on reset, so pinned lines remain pinned across resets. If the XIP memory power domain is not powered
down, memory contents do not change across power cycles of the switched core reset domain. The bootrom clears the
tag memory upon entering the flash boot or NSBOOT (USB boot) path, but watchdog scratch vector reboots can boot
directly into pinned XIP cache lines.

#### 4.4.2. QSPI Memory Interface (QMI)

Uncached accesses and cache misses require access to external memory. The QSPI memory interface (QMI) provides
this access, as documented in Section 12.14. The QMI supports:

- Up to two external QSPI devices, with separate chip selects and shared clock/data pins

### ◦ Banked configuration registers, including different^ SCK^ frequencies and QSPI opcodes

- Memory-mapped reads and writes (writes must be enabled via CTRL.WRITABLE_M0/CTRL.WRITABLE_M1)
- Serial/dual/quad-SPI transfer formats
- SCK speeds as high as^ clk_sys
- 8/16/32-bit accesses for uncached accesses, and 64-bit accesses for cache line fills
- Automatic chaining of sequentially addressed accesses into a single QSPI transfer
- Address translation (4^ ×^ 4 MB windows per QSPI device)

### ◦ Flash storage addresses can differ from runtime addresses, e.g. for multiple OTA upgrade image slots

### ◦ Allows code and data segments, or Secure and Non-secure images, to be mapped separately

- Direct-mode FIFO interface for programming and configuring external QSPI devices

XIP accesses via the two cache AHB ports, and from the DMA streaming hardware, arbitrate for access to the QMI. A
separate APB port configures the QMI.

The QMI is a new memory interface designed for RP2350, replacing the SSI peripheral on RP2040.

#### 4.4.3. Streaming DMA interface

As the flash is generally much larger than on-chip SRAM, it’s often useful to stream chunks of data into memory from
flash. It’s convenient to have the DMA stream this data in the background while software in the foreground does other
things. It’s even more convenient if code can continue to execute from flash whilst this takes place.

This doesn’t interact well with standard XIP operation because QMI serial transfers force lengthy bus stalls on the DMA.
These stalls are tolerable for a processor because an in-order processor tends to have nothing better to do while
waiting for an instruction fetch to retire, and because typical code execution tends to have much higher cache hit rates
than bulk streaming of infrequently accessed data. In contrast, stalling the DMA prevents any other active DMA
channels from making progress during this time, slowing overall DMA throughput.

The STREAM_ADDR and STREAM_CTR registers are used to program a linear sequence of flash reads. The XIP
subsystem performs these reads in the background in a best-effort fashion. To minimise impact on code executed from
flash whilst the stream is ongoing, the streaming hardware has lower priority access to the QMI than regular XIP
accesses, and there is a brief cooldown (9 cycles) between the last XIP cache miss and resuming streaming. This
avoids increases in initial access latency on XIP cache misses.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/flash/xip_stream/flash_xip_stream.c Lines 45 - 48

```
45 while (!(xip_ctrl_hw->stat & XIP_STAT_FIFO_EMPTY))
46 (void) xip_ctrl_hw->stream_fifo;
47 xip_ctrl_hw->stream_addr = (uint32_t) &random_test_data[0];
48 xip_ctrl_hw->stream_ctr = count_of(random_test_data);
```
The streamed data is pushed to a small FIFO, which generates DREQ signals that tell the DMA to collect the streamed
data. As the DMA does not initiate a read until after reading the data from flash, the DMA does not stall when accessing
the data. The DMA can then retrieve this data through the auxiliary AHB port, which provides direct single-cycle access
to the streaming data FIFO.

On RP2350, you can also use the auxiliary AHB port to access the QMI direct-mode FIFOs. This is faster than accessing

```
the FIFOs through the QMI APB configuration port. When QMI access chaining is enabled, the streaming XIP DMA is
close to the maximum theoretical QSPI throughput, but the direct-mode FIFOs are available on AHB for situations that
require 100% of the theoretical throughput.
```

69 true // Start immediately!
70 );
```
#### 4.4.4. Performance counters

```
The XIP subsystem provides two performance counters. These are 32 bits in size, saturate upon reaching 0xffffffff,
and are cleared by writing any value. They count:
```
1. The total number of XIP accesses, to any alias
2. The number of XIP accesses that resulted in a cache hit
This provides a way to profile the cache hit rate for common use cases.

31:12 Reserved. - -
11 WRITABLE_M1: If 1, enable writes to XIP memory window 1 (addresses
0x11000000 through 0x11ffffff, and their uncached mirrors). If 0, this region is
read-only.
```
```
XIP memory is read-only by default. This bit must be set to enable writes if a
RAM device is attached on QSPI chip select 1.
```
```
The default read-only behaviour avoids two issues with writing to a read-only
QSPI device (e.g. flash). First, a write will initially appear to succeed due to
caching, but the data will eventually be lost when the written line is evicted,
causing unpredictable behaviour.
```
```
Second, when a written line is evicted, it will cause a write command to be
issued to the flash, which can break the flash out of its continuous read mode.
After this point, flash reads will return garbage. This is a security concern, as it
allows Non-secure software to break Secure flash reads if it has permission to
write to any flash address.
```
```
Note the read-only behaviour is implemented by downgrading writes to reads,
so writes will still cause allocation of an address, but have no other effect.

9 SPLIT_WAYS: When 1, route all cached+Secure accesses to way 0 of the
cache, and route all cached+Non-secure accesses to way 1 of the cache.
```
```
This partitions the cache into two half-sized direct-mapped regions, such that
Non-secure code can not observe cache line state changes caused by Secure
execution.
```
```
A full cache flush is required when changing the value of SPLIT_WAYS. The
flush should be performed whilst SPLIT_WAYS is 0, so that both cache ways
are accessible for invalidation.

Bits Description Type Reset

8 MAINT_NONSEC: When 0, Non-secure accesses to the cache maintenance
address window (addr[27] == 1, addr[26] == 0) will generate a bus error. When
1, Non-secure accesses can perform cache maintenance operations by writing
to the cache maintenance address window.

```
Cache maintenance operations may be used to corrupt Secure data by
invalidating cache lines inappropriately, or map Secure content into a Non-
secure region by pinning cache lines. Therefore this bit should generally be set
to 0, unless Secure code is not using the cache.
```
```
Care should also be taken to clear the cache data memory and tag memory
before granting maintenance operations to Non-secure code.
```

7 NO_UNTRANSLATED_NONSEC: When 1, Non-secure accesses to the
uncached, untranslated window (addr[27:26] == 3) will generate a bus error.

```
RW 0x
```
5 NO_UNCACHED_NONSEC: When 1, Non-secure accesses to the uncached
window (addr[27:26] == 1) will generate a bus error. This may reduce the
number of SAU/MPU/PMP regions required to protect flash contents.

```
Note this does not disable access to the uncached, untranslated
window — see NO_UNTRANSLATED_SEC.
```
```
RW 0x

4 NO_UNCACHED_SEC: When 1, Secure accesses to the uncached window
(addr[27:26] == 1) will generate a bus error. This may reduce the number of
SAU/MPU/PMP regions required to protect flash contents.

```
Note this does not disable access to the uncached, untranslated
window — see NO_UNTRANSLATED_SEC.
```
```
RW 0x
```
3 POWER_DOWN: When 1, the cache memories are powered down. They retain
state, but can not be accessed. This reduces static power dissipation. Writing
1 to this bit forces CTRL_EN_SECURE and CTRL_EN_NONSECURE to 0, i.e. the
cache cannot be enabled when powered down.

```
RW 0x
```
2 Reserved. - -

1 EN_NONSECURE: When 1, enable the cache for Non-secure accesses. When
enabled, Non-secure XIP accesses to the cached (addr[26] == 0) window will
query the cache, and QSPI accesses are performed only if the requested data
is not present. When disabled, Secure access ignore the cache contents, and
always access the QSPI interface.

```
Accesses to the uncached (addr[26] == 1) window will never query the cache,
irrespective of this bit.

0 EN_SECURE: When 1, enable the cache for Secure accesses. When enabled,

There is no cache-as-SRAM address window. Cache lines are allocated for
SRAM-like use by individually pinning them, and keeping the cache enabled.

19 OE: Output enable (active-high). For single width (SPI), this field is ignored, and
SD0 is always set to output, with SD1 always set to input.

For dual and quad width (DSPI/QSPI), this sets whether the relevant SDx pads
are set to output whilst transferring this FIFO record. In this case the
command/address should have OE set, and the data transfer should have OE
set or clear depending on the direction of the transfer.

18 DWIDTH: Data width. If 0, hardware will transmit the 8 LSBs of the DIRECT_TX
DATA field, and return an 8-bit value in the 8 LSBs of DIRECT_RX. If 1, the full
16-bit width is used. 8-bit and 16-bit transfers can be mixed freely.

15:0 DATA: Data pushed here will be clocked out falling edges of SCK (or before
the very first rising edge of SCK, if this is the first pulse). For each byte clocked
out, the interface will simultaneously sample one byte, on rising edges of SCK,

## 4.5. OTP

```
RP2350 contains 8 kB of one-time-programmable storage (OTP), which stores:
```
- Manufacturing information such as unique device ID
- Boot configuration such as non-default crystal oscillator frequency
- Public key fingerprint(s) for boot signature enforcement
- Symmetric keys for decryption of external flash contents into SRAM
- User-defined contents, including bootable program images (Section 5.10.7)
The OTP storage is structured as 4096 × 24-bit rows. Each row contains 16 bits of data and 8 bits of parity information,
providing 8 kB of data storage. OTP bit cells are initially 0 and can be programmed to 1. However, they cannot be cleared
back to 0 under any circumstance. This ensures that security-critical flags, such as debug disables, are physically
impossible to clear once set. However, you must also take care to program the correct values.
For more information about the OTP subsystem, see Chapter 13.
