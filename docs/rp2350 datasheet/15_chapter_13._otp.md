# Chapter 13. OTP

```
RP2350 provides 8 kB of one-time programmable storage (OTP), which holds:
```
## • Preprogrammed per-device information, such as unique device identifier and oscillator trim values

## • Security configuration such as debug disable and secure boot enable

## • Public key fingerprints for secure boot

## • Symmetric keys for decryption of flash contents into SRAM

## • Configuration for the USB bootloader, such as customising VID/PID and descriptors

## • Bootable software images, for low-cost flashless applications or custom bootloaders

## • Any other user-defined data, such as per-device personalisation values

```
For the full listing of predefined OTP contents, see Section 13.10.
OTP is physically an array of 4096 rows of 24 bits each. You can directly access these 24-bit values, but there is also
hardware support for storing 16 bits of data in each row, with 6 bits of Hamming ECC protection and 2 bits of bit polarity
reversal protection, yielding an ECC data capacity of 8192 bytes.
On a blank device, the OTP contents is all zeroes, except for some basic device information pre-programmed during
manufacturing test. Each bit can be irreversibly programmed from zero to one. To program the OTP contents:
```
## • Directly access the registers using the SBPI bridge

## • Call the bootrom^ otp_access^ API (Section 5.4.8.21)

## • Use the PICOBOOT interface of the USB bootloader (Section 5.6)

```
RP2350 enforces page-based permissions on OTP to partition Secure from Non-secure data and to ensure that
contents that should not change do not change. The OTP address space is logically partitioned into 64 pages, each 64
rows in size, for a total of 128 bytes of ECC data per page. Pages initially have full read-write permissions, but can be
restricted to read-only or inaccessible for each of Secure, Non-secure and bootloader access.
The page permissions themselves are stored in OTP. Locking pages in this way is an irreversible operation, referred to
as hard locking. The hardware also supports soft locking, where a page’s permissions are further restricted by writing to
the relevant register in SW_LOCK0 through SW_LOCK63; this restriction remains in effect until the next OTP reset.
Resetting the OTP block also resets the processors, so soft locking can be used to restrict the availability of sensitive
content like decryption keys to early boot stages.
OTP access keys (Section 13.5.2) provide an additional layer of protection. A fixed challenge is written to a write-only
OTP area. Pages registered to that key require the key to be entered to a write-only register in order to open read or write
access. This supports configuration data that can be accessed or edited by the board manufacturer, but not by general
firmware running on the device.
```
## 13.1. OTP address map

```
The OTP hardware resides in a 128 kB region starting at 0x40120000 (OTP_BASE in the SDK). Bit 16 of the address is used
to select either the OTP control registers, in the lower 64 kB, or one of the OTP read data aliases, in the upper 64 kB of
this space.
The OTP control registers (Section 13.9) are aliased at 4 kB intervals to implement the usual set, clear, and XOR atomic
write aliases described in Section 2.1.3.
The read data region starting at 0x40130000 divides further into four aliases:
```
## • 0x40130000,^ OTP_DATA_BASE: ECC read alias. A 32-bit read returns the ECC-corrected data for two neighbouring rows, or

```
all-ones on permission failure. Only the first 8 kB is populated.
```
13.1. OTP address map 1268

- 0x40138000,^ OTP_DATA_GUARDED_BASE: ECC guarded read alias. Successful reads return the same data as^ OTP_DATA_BASE.
    Only the first 8 kB is populated.
- 0x40134000,^ OTP_DATA_RAW_BASE: raw read alias. A 32-bit read directly returns the 24-bit contents of a single row, with
    zeroes in the eight MSBs, or returns all-ones on permission failure.
- 0x4013c000,^ OTP_DATA_RAW_GUARDED_BASE: raw, guarded read alias. Successful reads return the same data as
    OTP_DATA_RAW_BASE.
Bit 14 of the address selects ECC (0) vs raw (1). Bit 15 of the address selects unguarded (0) vs guarded (1) access.
Guarded reads return the same data as unguarded reads, but perform additional hardware consistency checks and
return bus faults on permission failure. For more information, see Section 13.1.1.

 (^) IMPORTANT
The read data regions starting at 0x40130000 are accessible only when USR.DCTRL is set, otherwise all reads return a
bus error response. This bit is clear when the OTP is being programmed via the SBPI bridge.
Writing to the read data aliases is not a valid operation, and will always return a bus fault. The OTP is programmed by
the SBPI bridge, which is used internally by the bootrom otp_access API, Section 5.4.8.21.

#### 13.1.1. Guarded reads

```
Reads through the guarded aliases differ from unguarded reads in the following ways:
```
- Permission failures return bus faults rather than a bit pattern of all-ones.
- Uncorrectable ECC errors return a bus fault if detected.
- Guarded reads perform an additional hardware consistency check to detect power transients. If this check fails,
    the read returns a bus fault.
These checks help to make the OTP fail-safe in contexts where deliberate fault injection is a possibility. For example,
the RP2350 bootrom uses guarded reads to check boot configuration flags.
The data returned from a successful guarded read is the same as the data returned by a successful read from the
corresponding unguarded alias.

 (^) IMPORTANT
Users relying on OTP data in a Secure context should always perform guarded reads, and it is strongly
recommended to use ECC. For rows where ECC is not possible, software should take care to ensure the consistency
of data across multiple overlapping reads.

## 13.2. Background: OTP IP details

```
The RP2350 OTP subsystem uses the Synopsys NVM OTP IP, which comes in 3 parts:
```
- Integrated Power Supply (IPS), including:

### ◦ Charge Pump (for programming)

### ◦ Regulator (for reading)

- OTP Macro (SHF, Fuse)

### ◦ 4096 ×^ 24 (8 kB with ECC, 16-bit ECC write granularity)

- Access port (AP), providing:

13.2. Background: OTP IP details 1269

### ◦ Basic read access

### ◦ Programming access

### ◦ ECC and bit redundancy

### ◦ BOOT function, which polls for stable OTP power supply at start-of-day

## 13.3. Background: OTP hardware architecture

```
This diagram shows the integration of the three Synopsys IP components, and the Raspberry Pi hardware added to
make this all function in the context of RP2350’s system and security architecture. More specifically:
```
- APB interface(s) to connect to the SoC
- Internal ring oscillator with clock edge randomisation
- Power-up state machine, running off the ring oscillator
- Lock shim, sitting between the SNPS RTL and the memory core (fuse)
Figure 142. OTParchitecture

```
The OTP subsystem clock is initially provided by the OTP boot oscillator (Section 13.3.3) during hardware startup, but
switches to clk_ref before any software runs on the processors. The frequency of clk_ref must not exceed 25 MHz
when accessing the OTP.
```
#### 13.3.1. Lock shim

```
The lock shim is inserted between the Synopsys AP block and the SHF block, and is used to enforce read/write page
locks, based on:
```
- The OTP address presented on the AP^ →^ SHF bus
- The read/write strobe on the AP^ →^ SHF bus
- The security attribute of the upstream bus access which caused this SHF access (assumed to be Secure if SBPI is
    currently enabled via USR.DCTRL)
Because the Synopsys AP performs both reads and writes in the course of programming an OTP row, it is impossible to
disable reads to an address without also disabling writes. Three lock states are supported:

13.3. Background: OTP hardware architecture 1270

- Read/Write
- Read-only
- Inaccessible
The full locking scheme is described in in Section 13.5, but to summarise:
- The lock state of each OTP page is read from OTP at boot time.
- There is a separate copy of the lock state for Secure/Non-secure accesses. The lock shim applies the Secure read
permissions to Secure reads, and the Non-secure read permissions to Non-secure reads. There is no such rule for
writes, because Non-secure code is not capable of accessing the programming hardware.
- The lock encoding in OTP storage is such that a page can always be locked down to a less permissive state (in the
order RW → RO → Inaccessible) but can never return to a more permissive state.
- Software can advance the state of each individual lock at runtime without programming OTP, and this lasts until
the OTP PSM is re-run.
- Software locks also obey the lock progression order (RW^ →^ RO^ →^ Inaccessible) and can not be regressed.
The full locking scheme is described in in Section 13.5.

#### 13.3.2. External interfaces

```
The OTP integration has one upstream APB interface, which splits internally onto two separate interfaces. This
guarantees the hardware only serves a single upstream APB access at a time, with a single PPROT security level.
The first APB interface is the data interface (or data bridge) (OTPD). It has the following characteristics:
```
- Read-only
- Connects to the Synopsys device access port (DAP)
- Data interface reads always return 32 or 24 bits of valid data
- The data interface address is rounded down to a multiple of 32 bits, so that narrow reads return the correct byte
    lanes
- There is an 8 kB window which supports 32-bit ECC reads

### ◦ Each upstream bus read is split into two OTP accesses, each of which returns 16 bits of error-corrected datafrom the OTP

- There is an 8 kB window which supports guarded 32-bit ECC reads, and returns a bus error if the guarding read
    fails.

### ◦ Functions the same as the ECC read window, but reads the Synopsys boot word before accessing the OTParray, and return a bus error if the first read does not match the expected constant

### ◦ Used to increase confidence in software OTP reads in the bootrom

- There is a 16 kB window which supports 24-bit raw reads

### ◦ Each access returns a single raw 24-bit OTP row, bypassing error correction

### ◦ Software must provide its own redundancy (e.g. triple majority vote)

### ◦ Allows bit-mutable data structures, such as boot flags, or thermometer counters

```
The second APB interface is the command interface. This provides two main functions:
```
- Provides a bridge to the SBPI interface (Synopsys proprietary Serial and Byte-Parallel Interface bus)

### ◦ SBPI connects to the Programmable Master Controller (PMC), with access to the DAP, DATAPATH, chargepump (IPS), and fuse memory (SHF)

13.3. Background: OTP hardware architecture 1271

### ◦ Allows arbitrary OTP operations, including programming

### ◦ Only accessible to Secure reads and writes

- Provides control registers for Raspberry Pi hardware

### ◦ Registers have different accessibility according to Secure/Non-secure and read/write

### ◦ Software lock registers are always readable by both security domains

```
Hardware configuration data read from OTP during the power-up sequence drives system-level control signals, e.g.
disabling CoreSight APs. This is described in more detail in (Section 13.3.4).
A single system-level interrupt output (IRQ) generates interrupts for the following sources:
```
- Secure read failed due to locks
- Non-secure read failed due to locks
- Write failed due to locks
- SBPI FLAG, used by the PMC to signal completion
- Data port access when DCTRL is set error

### ◦ USR.DCTRLdebugging SW if a data access is attempted whilst the DAP is inaccessible^ tells the SNPS AP whether the SBPI bridge or data bridge can access the memory array; this help

```
Any failed access also returns a bus fault (PSLVERR). To determine whether an OTP address is accessible, query the lock
tables.
Non-secure code cannot access the interrupt status registers.
```
#### 13.3.3. OTP boot oscillator

```
The OTP startup sequence (Section 13.3.4) runs from a local ring oscillator, dedicated to the OTP subsystem. This is
separate from the system ring oscillator (the ROSC) which provides the system clock to run the processors during boot.
```
- The OTP boot oscillator is the only clock used by the OTP power-up state machine
- The OTP boot oscillator dynamically randomises its own frequency controls, to deliberately add jitter to the clock
- The OTP boot oscillator stops when the PSM completes, and does not start again until the OTP resets
- The OTP clock automatically switches to^ clk_ref^ when the OTP boot oscillator stops
The boot oscillator has a nominal frequency of 12MHz. It provides the clock for reading out hardware configuration
from OTP, including the critical flags (Section 13.4) which configure hardware security features such as debug disable
and the glitch detectors.
Keeping this oscillator local to the OTP hardware subsystem reduces the power signature of the clock itself, due to the
lower switched clock capacitance. Along with the random jitter of the frequency controls, this helps frustrate attempts
to recover OTP access keys and debug keys via power signature analysis attacks, or to disable security features by
timing fault injection against the OTP clock.
Only the OTP boot oscillator enables the ROSC frequency randomisation feature by default: for later operations using
the system ROSC (Section 8.3), you must explicitly enable this feature on that oscillator, by programming the ROSC
control registers. The crystal oscillator (XOSC) does not support frequency randomisation.

#### 13.3.4. Power-up state machine

```
The OTP is the second item in the switched core domain’s Power-On State Machine (Section 7.4), after the processor
cold reset. OTP does not release its rst_done, or enable any debug interface (including the factory test JTAG described in
Section 10.10), until the OTP PSM reads out OTP-resident hardware configuration. The rst_done output to the system
```
13.3. Background: OTP hardware architecture 1272

```
PSM holds the rest of the system in reset until the OTP PSM completes, so that no software runs until the OTP’s
contents are known.
The OTP boot sequence runs from a local ring oscillator. This oscillator is dedicated to the OTP subsystem, and is
separate from the main system ROSC used by the processors at boot. The sequence is:
```
1. First, the PSM runs the Synopsys boot instruction. This has the following steps:
    a. Wait for the power supply to return a 'good' value.
b. Read consistency check location until hardware sees the correct value for 16 successive reads. Consistency
checks use predefined words stored in mask ROM cells with similar analogue properties to OTP cells.
2. Read critical flags (non-ECC): each critical bit is redundant across 8 OTP rows, with three-of-eight vote for each
    flag.
3. Read hardware access keys via ECC read interface.
4. Read valid bits for hardware access keys, including the debug keys (Section 3.5.9.2)
5. Initialise page lock registers from the lock page via raw read interface.
6. Assert rst_done signal to the system power-on state machine
7. The system reset sequence continues, starting with the system ROSC
RP2350 A3 adds correctness checks and robustness to the PSM. For more information about these additions, see
RP2350-E16.

## 13.4. Critical flags

```
Critical flags enable hardware security features which are fundamental to RP2350’s secure boot implementation. The
OTP power-up state machine reads critical flags very early in the system reset sequence, before any code runs on the
processors.
Most critical flags are in the main Boot Configuration page, page 1. These are listed under CRIT1 in the OTP data listing.
The exceptions are the Arm/RISC-V disable flags, which are in the Chip Info page, page 0. This page is made read-only
during factory programming, so users can not write to the CRIT0 flags.
Critical flags define 0 as the unprogrammed value, and 1 as the programmed value. On a blank device, all of the CRIT
flags are 0. The reset value specified below is the value assigned to the internal logic net between the OTP reset being
applied and the OTP PSM completing. For example, the reset value of 1 for the debug disable flags implies that debug is
not accessible whilst the OTP PSM is running, but may be available afterward, depending on the value read from OTP
storage.
```
- ARM_DISABLE^ (reset:^0 ): Force the ARCHSEL register to RISC-V, at higher priority than RISC-V disable flag, secure boot
    enable flag, or default boot architecture flag.
- RISCV_DISABLE^ (reset:^0 ): Force the ARCHSEL register to Arm, at higher priority than the default boot architecture flag.
- SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE^ (reset:^1 ): Enable boot signature checking in bootrom, disable factory JTAG, and force the
    ARCHSEL register to Arm, at higher priority than the default boot architecture flag.
- SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE^ (reset:^1 ): Disable factory JTAG, block Secure accesses from Mem-APs, and block halt
    requests to Secure processors.

### ◦ Prevents secure AP accesses by masking their^ ap_secure_en^ signals.

### ◦ Prevents secure processor halting by masking the Cortex-M33’s^ SPIDEN^ and^ NSPIDEN^ signals.

### ◦ Secure debug can be re-enabled by a Secure register in the OTP block.

### ◦ Re-enable of Secure debug can be disabled by a Secure write-1-only lock register, also in the OTP block.

- DEBUG_DISABLE^ (reset:^1 ): Completely disable the Mem-APs, in addition to disabling everything disabled by the secure

13.4. Critical flags 1273

```
debug disable flag.
```
- BOOT_ARCH^ (reset:^0 ): set the reset value of the ARCHSEL register (0^ →^ Arm, 1^ →^ RISC-V) if it has not been forced by
    other critical flags.

### ◦ Not critical, but hardware-read.

- GLITCH_DETECTOR_ENABLE^ (reset:^0 ): pass an enable signal to the glitch detectors so that they can be armed before any
    software runs.
- GLITCH_DETECTOR_SENS(reset:^0 ): configure the initial sensitivity of the glitch detector circuits.
Critical flags are encoded with a three-of-eight vote across eight consecutive OTP rows. Each flag is redundantly
programmed to the same bit position in eight consecutive rows. Hardware considers the flag to be set if the bit reads as
1 in at least three of these eight rows. The flag is considered clear if no more than two bits are observed to be set.

 (^) NOTE
As of RP2350 A3 the ARM_DISABLE flag has no effect, removing a potential unlock path for debug on a secured
RP2350. Additionally, the combination of RISCV_DISABLE=1 and BOOT_ARCH=1 is decoded to an invalid state and the chip
will not boot.
JTAG disable is ignored only if the customer RMA flag (Section 13.7) is set.
For further discussion of the effects of the critical flags, see:

- Section 3.5.9.1 for the effects of the debug disable flags
- Section 3.9 for the effects of the Arm/RISC-V architecture select flags
- Section 10.9 for the effects of the glitch detector configuration flags
- Section 10.1.1 for discussion of the bootrom secure boot support enabled by the^ SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE^ flag

## 13.5. Page locks

```
The OTP protection hardware logically segments OTP into 64 pages (0 through 63), each 128 bytes in size, or
equivalently 64 OTP rows.
Each page has a set of lock registers which determine read and write access for that page from Secure and Non-secure
code. The lock registers are preloaded from OTP at reset, and can then be advanced (i.e. made less permissive) by
software. Lock registers themselves are always world-readable.
Pages 61 through 63 are not so neatly described by a single set of lock registers. These pages store lock initialisation
metadata. For more details, see Section 13.5.4. This section describes the more common case of a page protected by a
set of page locks.
```
#### 13.5.1. Lock progression

```
Due to hardware constraints (Section 13.3.1), read and write restrictions are not orthogonal: it’s impossible to disallow
reads to an address without also disallowing writes. So, the progression of locking for a given page is:
```
0. Read/Write
1. Read-only
2. Inaccessible
Lock state only increases. This is enforced in two ways:
- Due to the nature of OTP and the choice of encoding, you cannot lower the OTP values preloaded to the lock
registers during boot.

13.5. Page locks 1274

- The lock registers ignore writes of lower-than-current values.
Secure and Non-secure use separate lock values, which can advance independently of one another. There is no
hardware distinction between Non-secure Read/Write and Non-secure Read-only, since Non-secure can not directly
write to the OTP anyway. It is still worth encoding, because Secure software performing a write on Non-secure
software’s behalf can check and enforce the Non-secure write lock.
You can reprogram bits from any state to any higher state. Locks use a 2-bit thermometer code: the initial all-zeroes
state is read-write, and locks are advanced by programming first bit 0, then bit 1.
Lock bits in OTP are triple-redundant with a majority vote. They can’t be ECC-protected, because they may be mutated
bit-by-bit over multiple programming operations.
The OTP-resident lock bits are write-protected by their own Secure lock level. The lock pages are always world-readable.
The Secure lock registers can be advanced by Secure code, and are world-readable.
The Non-secure lock registers can be advanced by Secure or Non-secure code, and are world-readable.

#### 13.5.2. OTP access keys

```
Page 61 contains 128-bit keys. Each key has a valid bit: when set, the key becomes completely inaccessible to
software. The keys are always read out into hidden registers by hardware during startup so that hardware can perform
key comparisons without exposing the keys to software.
Pages can require specific keys for some page permissions. To unlock the page, the user writes their key to a write-only
register in the OTP block. The page remains unlocked for as long as the correct key is present in this register. To re-lock
the page, erase the active key by writing zeroes to the key register.
The per-page lock config specifies the following:
```
- a^ read key^ index 1-7, or 0 if there is no read key
- a^ write key^ index 1-7 or 0 if there is no write key
- the^ no-key state: either Read-only or Inaccessible, state of the page when no registered key has been entered by
    software into the key register
The no-key state is encoded as follows:
- 0 for Read-only (lock level 1)
- 1 for Inaccessible (lock level 2).

#####  TIP

```
Key index 7 does not exist in the configuration. If you specify key index 7, it is guaranteed to never match.
```
```
The hardware determines the key lock level by comparing the entered key to the key config of the current page, as
follows:
```
1. If no keys are registered, the key lock level is 0
2. Else if keys are registered and no matching key is entered, the key lock level is 2 or 1 depending on the "no-key
    state" config
3. Else if a write key is registered and present, the key lock level is 0
4. Else if a read key is registered and present, the key lock level is 1
Hardware compares the key lock level to the page’s lock level for the current security domain (Secure/Non-secure) and
takes whichever is higher. For example, if a page has been made Non-secure read-only, there is nothing a key can do to
make it Non-secure writable.
There are six 128-bit access keys stored in the OTP. Keys 5 and 6 also function as the Secure debug access key and

13.5. Page locks 1275

```
Non-secure debug access key, respectively. See Section 3.5.9.2 for information on how the debug keys affect external
debug access.
You might use OTP access keys if a bootloader contains OTP configuration that needs to be Secure-writable only to the
board owner, not to general Secure software on the device.
```
#### 13.5.3. Lock encoding in OTP

```
Page locks are encoded as a 16-bit value. This value is stored as a pair of triple-redundant bytes, each byte occupying a
24-bit OTP row.
The lock halfword is encoded as follows:
Bits Purpose
2:0 Write key index, or 0 if no write key
5:3 Read key index, or 0 if no read key
6 No-key state, 0=Read-only 1=Inaccessible
7 Reserved
```
9:8 (^) Secure lock state (thermometer code 0 → 2)
11:10 Non-secure lock state (thermometer code 0 → 2)
13:12 PicoBoot lock state (thermometer code 0 → 2) or software-defined use if PicoBoot OTP is disabled
15:12 (^) Reserved

#### 13.5.4. Special pages

```
The following pages require special case handling in their lock checks:
```
- The lock word region itself (pages 62 and 63)

### ◦ Lock words are always world-readable

### ◦ Lock words are writable by Secure code if the lock word itself permits Secure writes

### ◦ Consequently, lock words 62 and 63 are considered "spare", since they do not protect pages 62 and 63; thepage 63 lock word is repurposed for the RMA flag

- The hardware access key page (page 61)

### ◦ Contains OTP access keys and debug access keys

### ◦ Each key also has a valid bit (rbit)

### ◦ Page 61 (key page) has all of the usual protections from the page 61 lock word

### ◦ If a key’s valid bit is set, that key is inaccessible; the converse is not necessarily true

```
Page 0, known as the chip info page, is not a special page. Raspberry Pi sets page 0 to read-only during factory test,
after writing chip identification and calibration values.
```
#### 13.5.5. Permissions of blank devices

```
Each RP2350 device has some information programmed during manufacturing test. At this time, a small number of
hard page lock bits are also programmed:
```
13.5. Page locks 1276

- Page 0, which contains chip information, is read-only for all accesses.
- Pages 1 and 2, which contain boot config and boot key fingerprints, are read-only for Non-secure access, read-
    write for Secure access, and read-write for bootloader access.
- Page 62, which contains only the page 62 lock word, is read-only for Non-secure access, read-write for Secure
    access, and read-write for bootloader access (as a partial workaround for RP2350-E28).
- Page 63, which contains the RMA flag, is read-only for Non-secure and bootloader access, and read-write for
    Secure access.
This minimal set of default permissions on blank devices avoids certain classes of security model violation, like Non-
secure code being able to brick the chip by overwriting the boot key fingerprints with invalid data. In this context, the
term blank device refers to a device that has gone through manufacturing test programming, but has not had any other
OTP bits programmed by the user.
You can add additional soft or hard locks to these default permissions, with the exception of page 0. Page 0 cannot be
hard-locked, since the secure read-only permission prevents a user from altering its lock word.
Lock words 2 through 61, covering all pages with user-defined contents, are left unprogrammed. On a blank device,
these pages are fully accessible from all domains. Before launching any Non-secure application, you should apply at
least a soft read-only lock to all pages that are not explicitly allocated for Non-secure use. To do this, write to
SW_LOCK2 through SW_LOCK61. For devices that you don’t expect to RMA, such as those that have passed board-level
manufacturing tests, you should lock secure writes to the RMA flag.

## 13.6. Error Correction Code (ECC)

```
ECC-protected rows store data in the following structure, accessible through a raw alias:
```
- Bits^ 23:22: bit repair by polarity (BRP) flag
- Bits^ 21:16: modified Hamming ECC code
- Bits^ 15:0^ (the 16 LSBs): data
RP2350 stores the following error correction data in the 8 MSBs of each 24-bit row:
- a 6-bit modified Hamming code ECC, providing single-error-correct and double-error-detect capabilities
- 2 bits of bit repair by polarity (BRP), which supports inverting the entire row at programming time to repair a single
set bit that should be clear
Writes first encode ECC, then BRP. Reads first decode BRP, then ECC. When reading through an ECC data alias (Section
13.1), hardware performs correction transparently. ECC programming operations (writes) automatically generate ECC
bits when you use the bootrom otp_access API (Section 5.4.8.21).
ECC is not suitable for data that mutates one bit at a time, since the ECC value is derived from the entire 16-bit data
value. When storing data without ECC, use another form of redundancy, such as 3-way majority vote.

#### 13.6.1. Bit repair by polarity (BRP)

```
Bit repair by polarity (BRP) compensates for a single bit present at time of programming.
When programming a row, hardware or software first calculates a 24-bit target value consisting of:
```
- Two zeroes in bits^ 23:
- 6-bit Hamming ECC in bits^ 21:
- 16-bit data value in bits^ 15:
Before programming, an OTP row should contain all zeros. However, sometimes OTP rows contain a single bit that is
already set to 1 , either due to manufacturing flaws or previous programming. If a bit is already set ( 1 ) in an OTP row

13.6. Error Correction Code (ECC) 1277

```
before programming, BRP checks the status of the corresponding bit in the target value. BRP compensates for this
single set bit in one of two ways, depending on the corresponding value in the target value:
```
- If the bit is clear (^0 ), BRP inverts the target row and writes two ones in bits^ 23:22.
- If the bit is set (^1 ), BRP does not invert the target row, leaving two zeroes in bits^ 23:22.
When you read an OTP value through an ECC alias (Section 13.1), BRP checks for two ones in bits 23:22. When both bits
23 and 22 are set, BRP inverts the entire row before passing it to the modified Hamming code stage.
BRP makes it possible to store any 22-bit value in a row that initially has at most one bit set, preserving the correction
margin of the modified Hamming code. During manufacturing test, hardware scans the entire OTP array to ensure no
rows contain more than one pre-set bit.

#### 13.6.2. Modified Hamming ECC

```
ECC generates six parity bits based on the data value stored in bits 15:0 of an OTP row. When programming a row, ECC
generates those six parity bits and includes them in the target value as bits 21:16. This code consists of:
```
- A 5-bit Hamming code that identifies single-bit errors
- An even parity bit which allows two-bit errors to be detected in the Hamming code and the original 16-bit data
When you read an OTP value through an ECC alias (Section 13.1), ECC recalculates the six parity bits based on the value
read from the OTP row. Then, ECC XORs the original six parity bits with the newly-calculated parity bits. This generates
6 new bits:
- the 5 LSBs are the^ syndrome, a unique bit pattern that corresponds to each possible bit flip in the data value
- the MSB distinguishes between odd and even numbers of bit flips
If all 6 bits in this value are zero, ECC did not detect an error. If the MSB is 1, the syndrome should indicate a single-bit
error. ECC flips the corresponding data bit to recover from the error. If the MSB is 0, but the syndrome contains a value
other than 0, the ECC detected an unrecoverable multi-bit error.
You can calculate 5-bit Hamming codes and parity bits with the following C code (adapted from the RP2350 bootrom
source):

```
uint32_t even_parity(uint32_t input) {
uint32_t rc = 0;
while (input) {
rc ^= input & 1;
input >>= 1;
}
return rc;
}
const uint32_t otp_ecc_parity_table[6] = {
0b0000001010110101011011,
0b0000000011011001101101,
0b0000001100011110001110,
0b0000000000011111110000,
0b0000001111100000000000,
0b
};
uint32_t s_otp_calculate_ecc(uint16_t x) {
uint32_t p = x;
for (uint i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
p |= even_parity(p & otp_ecc_parity_table[i]) << (16 + i);
}
return p;

## 13.7. Device decommissioning (RMA)

```
Decommissioning refers to destroying a device’s sensitive contents and restoring some test or debug functionality
when a device reaches the end of its security lifecycle. The OTP hardware can’t actually destroy user data without
circumventing write protection in some way. Instead, decommissioning is implemented with the RMA flag, which
modifies devices in the following ways:
```
- re-enables factory test JTAG which is otherwise disabled by the secure boot critical flag
- makes pages 3 through 61 inaccessible
The RMA flag doesn’t change permissions for page 0 (manufacturing data), pages 1 and 2 (boot configuration), page 61
(OTP access keys), or pages 62 and 63 (locks).
The RMA flag is encoded in a spare bit of the page 63 lock word. This lock word would otherwise be unused, since page
63 is one of the lock pages; consequently, it is not protected by a lock word. Instead, each lock word protects itself.
Like all other lock words, the page 63 lock word is protected by its own locks, which means it can be hard- and soft-
locked to prevent the RMA flag being set. Locking the RMA flag makes it impossible to re-enable the factory JTAG
interface if any of CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE, CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE or CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE is set.
This makes it impossible for Raspberry Pi to re-test such devices if they are returned for fault analysis.

#####  IMPORTANT

```
Setting the RMA flag does not destroy OTP contents, it merely renders it inaccessible. The design intent is for this to
be irreversible, but hardware is never perfect. This is something the user’s threat model must account for when
programming the RMA flag on devices with sensitive OTP contents — for example, by personalising per-device OTP
secrets to avoid class breaks if an attacker is able to retrieve the keys.
```
## 13.8. Imaging Vulnerability

```
The RP2350 OTP is intended to store boot key fingerprints and boot decryption keys. The ability to protect encrypted
contents in external flash storage depends on the ability to protect the OTP contents from unauthorised or external
reads. The OTP uses antifuse bit cells, which store data as a charge, similar to a flash bit cell. They do not make use of
a physical structural change as used in a traditional fuse cell. This makes them resistant to many imaging techniques,
such as optical and scanning electron microscopy. However antifuse cells can be imaged using a novel technique
called passive voltage contrast (PVC), using a focused ion beam (FIB) device.
PVC Whitepaper
For more information on passive voltage contrast imaging, read the whitepaper by IOActive:
https://www.ioactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IOActive-RP2350HackingChallenge.pdf
```
```
This process involves decapsulating the die. Therefore physical access to the device is a strict requirement, and there is
a moderate chance of destroying the die without being able to recover its OTP contents.
```
#### 13.8.1. Best Practices

```
The following best practices minimise your susceptibility to imaging of OTP contents:
```
13.7. Device decommissioning (RMA) 1279

- Provision unique keys per device, rather than sharing secrets across a fleet of devices.
- Use^ chaff^ as described in the next section to make imaging more difficult.

#### 13.8.2. Chaff

```
OTP bits come in pairs: two bits are stored in the isolated gates of two transistors, with a common bit line between
them. This structure is known as a bit cell. In each 64-row OTP page, rows i and 32 + i share the same bit cells. For
example, the ECC halfwords BOOTKEY0_0 and BOOTKEY2_0 are physically colocated.
The particulars of the PVC technique make it difficult to distinguish which of the two bits in a bit cell is set. If one bit in
each pair is known to be zero — for example, a key stored at the bottom of an otherwise blank page — then the data can
be trivially read from the PVC image. However the presence of unknown data in both bits frustrates these attempts.
This fact can be exploited by storing data redundantly in the top and bottom half of each page. Specifically:
```
- Store arbitrary data in each row^ i^ from^0 to^31.
- Store the 24-bit bitwise complement of those values in each row^ 32 + i.
The bitwise operations specified here are on the entire 24-bit raw row contents, including the ECC bit pattern.
An alternative technique is to store a random value in row 32 + i and the XOR of that random value with the desired data
value in row i. This is advantageous from a power side channel perspective because it avoids reading the secret value
directly from OTP, and the example RP2350 encrypted bootloader uses a similar technique with a 4-way XOR. However
the bitwise complement technique described above is recommended for pairwise chaff. This is the same as the XOR
technique with a fixed XOR pattern of 0xffffff.

#### OTP: ARCHSEL Register

```
Offset: 0x158
Description
Architecture select (Arm/RISC-V). The default and allowable values of this register are constrained by the critical
boot flags.
```
13.9. List of registers 1289

This register is reset by the earliest reset in the switched core power domain (before a processor cold reset).
Cores sample their architecture select signal on a warm reset. The source of the warm reset could be the system
power-up state machine, the watchdog timer, Arm SYSRESETREQ or from RISC-V hartresetreq.
Note that when an Arm core is deselected, its cold reset domain is also held in reset, since in particular the
SYSRESETREQ bit becomes inaccessible once the core is deselected. Note also the RISC-V cores do not have a cold
reset domain, since their corresponding controls are located in the Debug Module.

#### OTP: BOOTDIS Register

```
Offset: 0x160
Description
Tell the bootrom to ignore scratch register boot vectors (both power manager and watchdog) on the next power up.
If an early boot stage has soft-locked some OTP pages in order to protect their contents from later stages, there is a risk
that Secure code running at a later stage can unlock the pages by performing a watchdog reset that resets the OTP.
This register can be used to ensure that the bootloader runs as normal on the next power up, preventing Secure code at
```

Should be used in conjunction with the power manager BOOTDIS register.

```

1 NEXT: This flag always ORs writes into its current contents. It can be set but
not cleared by software.
The BOOTDIS_NEXT bit is OR’d into the BOOTDIS_NOW bit when the core is
powered down. Simultaneously, the BOOTDIS_NEXT bit is cleared. Setting this
bit means that the boot scratch registers will be ignored following the next
core power down.
This flag should be set by an early boot stage that has soft-locked OTP pages,
to prevent later stages from unlocking it via watchdog reset.
```
```
RW 0x0
```
```
0 NOW: When the core is powered down, the current value of BOOTDIS_NEXT is
OR’d into BOOTDIS_NOW, and BOOTDIS_NEXT is cleared.
The bootrom checks this flag before reading the boot scratch registers. If it is
set, the bootrom clears it, and ignores the BOOT registers. This prevents
Secure software from diverting the boot path before a bootloader has had the
chance to soft lock OTP pages containing sensitive data.

## 13.10. Predefined OTP data locations

```
This section lists OTP locations used by either the hardware (particularly the OTP power-on state machine), the
bootrom, or both. This listing is for RP2350 silicon revision A2.
OTP locations are listed by row number, not by address. When read through an ECC alias, OTP rows are spaced two
bytes apart in the system address space; when read through a raw alias, OTP rows are four bytes apart. Therefore the
row numbers given here should be multiplied by two or four appropriately when reading OTP contents directly from
software. The OTP APIs provided by the bootrom use OTP row numbers directly, so this row-to-byte-address conversion
is not necessary when accessing OTP through these APIs.
For normal (non-guarded) reads, you can access error-corrected content starting at OTP_DATA_BASE (0x40130000), and raw
content starting at OTP_DATA_RAW_BASE (0x40134000). The register listings below indicate whether or not a given OTP row
contains error-corrected contents. OTP never mixes error-corrected and non-error-corrected content in the same row.
```
13.10. Predefined OTP data locations 1292

All predefined data fields have some form of redundancy. Where ECC is not viable, for instance because a location is
expected to have individual bits programmed at different times, best-of-three majority vote is used instead. The only
exception to this is the critical hardware flags in CRIT0 and CRIT1. These flags use a three-of-eight vote encoding for
each individual flag: the flag is considered set when at least three bits are set out of the eight redundant bit locations.
The description for each row indicates the type of redundancy.
Pages 3 through 60 (rows 0x0c0 through 0xf3f) are free for arbitrary user content such as OTP-resident bootloaders, and
Raspberry Pi will avoid allocating any of these locations for bootrom configuration if possible. This is a total of 7424
bytes of ECC-protected content.
Page 2 (rows 0x080 through 0x0bf) is also available for user content if secure boot is disabled. It is partially available if
secure boot is enabled and fewer than four boot key fingerprints are registered. This is an additional 128 ECC bytes
potentially available for user content.
Pages 0, 1, and 61 through 63 are reserved for future use by Raspberry Pi. Software should avoid allocating content in
these regions, even if they currently have no defined use in this data listing.

0x000 CHIPID0 Bits 15:0 of public device ID. (ECC)
The CHIPID0..3 rows contain a 64-bit random identifier for this
chip, which can be read from the USB bootloader PICOBOOT
interface or from the get_sys_info ROM API.
The number of random bits makes the occurrence of twins
exceedingly unlikely: for example, a fleet of a hundred million
devices has a 99.97% probability of no twinned IDs. This is
estimated to be lower than the occurrence of process errors in
the assignment of sequential random IDs, and for practical
purposes CHIPID may be treated as unique.

0x004 RANDID0 Bits 15:0 of private per-device random number (ECC)
The RANDID0..7 rows form a 128-bit random number generated
during device test.
This ID is not exposed through the USB PICOBOOT GET_INFO
command or the ROM get_sys_info() API. However note that the
USB PICOBOOT OTP access point can read the entirety of page
0, so this value is not meaningfully private unless the USB
PICOBOOT interface is disabled via the
DISABLE_BOOTSEL_USB_PICOBOOT_IFC flag in BOOT_FLAGS0.

15:0 Bits 15:0 of public device ID. (ECC)
The CHIPID0..3 rows contain a 64-bit random identifier for this chip, which can
be read from the USB bootloader PICOBOOT interface or from the get_sys_info
ROM API.
The number of random bits makes the occurrence of twins exceedingly
unlikely: for example, a fleet of a hundred million devices has a 99.97%
probability of no twinned IDs. This is estimated to be lower than the
occurrence of process errors in the assignment of sequential random IDs, and
for practical purposes CHIPID may be treated as unique.

19 DOUBLE_TAP: Enable entering BOOTSEL mode via double-tap of the
RUN/RSTn pin. Adds a significant delay to boot time, as configured by
DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY.
This functions by waiting at startup (i.e. following a reset) to see if a second
reset is applied soon afterward. The second reset is detected by the bootrom
with help of the POWMAN_CHIP_RESET_DOUBLE_TAP flag, which is not reset
by the external reset pin, and the bootrom enters BOOTSEL mode (NSBOOT) to
await further instruction over USB or UART.

###### RO -

```
18:16 DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY: Adjust how long to wait for a second reset when double
tap BOOTSEL mode is enabled via DOUBLE_TAP. The minimum is 50
milliseconds, and each unit of this field adds an additional 50 milliseconds.
For example, settings this field to its maximum value of 7 will cause the chip
to wait for 400 milliseconds at boot to check for a second reset which
requests entry to BOOTSEL mode.
200 milliseconds (DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY=3) is a good intermediate value.

Each bit in this field corresponds to one of the four 256-bit boot key hashes

A KEY_VALID bit is ignored if the corresponding KEY_INVALID bit is set. Boot
keys are considered valid only when KEY_VALID is set and KEY_INVALID is
clear.
Do not mark a boot key as KEY_VALID if it does not contain a valid SHA-256
hash of your secp256k1 public key. Verify keys after programming, before
setting the KEY_VALID bits — a boot key with uncorrectable ECC faults will
render your device unbootable if secure boot is enabled.
Do not enable secure boot without first installing a valid key. This will render
your device unbootable.

The table has 16 rows, each of which are also ECC and marked valid by the
corresponding valid bit in USB_BOOT_FLAGS (ECC).
The entries are either _VALUEs where the 16 bit value is used as is, or
_STRDEFs which acts as a pointers to a string value.
The value stored in a _STRDEF is two separate bytes: The low seven bits of the
first (LSB) byte indicates the number of characters in the string, and the top bit
of the first (LSB) byte if set to indicate that each character in the string is two
bytes (Unicode) versus one byte if unset. The second (MSB) byte represents
the location of the string data, and is encoded as the number of rows from this
USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR; i.e. the row of the start of the string is
USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR value + msb_byte.
In each case, the corresponding valid bit enables replacing the default value
for the corresponding item provided by the boot rom.
Note that Unicode _STRDEFs are only supported for
USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT_STRDEF, USB_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER_STRDEF
and USB_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER_STRDEF. Unicode values will be ignored if
specified for other fields, and non-unicode values for these three items will be
converted to Unicode characters by setting the upper 8 bits to zero.
Note that if the USB_WHITE_LABEL structure or the corresponding strings are
not readable by BOOTSEL mode based on OTP permissions, or if alignment
requirements are not met, then the corresponding default values are used.
The index values indicate where each field is located (row
USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR value + index):
