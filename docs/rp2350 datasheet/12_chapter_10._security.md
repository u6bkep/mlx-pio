# Chapter 10. Security

```
This chapter describes the RP2350 security model and the hardware that implements it. This chapter contains two
separate overviews: one for Arm, and one for RISC-V. The architectures have distinct security features and levels of
bootrom support.
```
## 10.1. Overview (Arm)

```
RP2350 provides hardware and bootrom security features for three purposes:
```
1. Prevent unauthorised code from running on the device
2. Prevent unauthorised reading of user code and data
3. Isolate trusted and untrusted software, running concurrently on the device, from one another

```
Point 1 is referred to in this datasheet as secure boot. Secure boot is a prerequisite to points two and three because
running unauthorised code on the device allows that code to access device internals. The bootrom secure boot
implementation and related hardware security features implement the root of trust for secure RP2350 applications;
bootrom contents are fixed at design time and immutable.
Point 2 is referred to in this datasheet as encrypted boot. Encrypted boot is an additional layer of protection which
makes it more difficult to clone devices, or dump and reverse-engineer device firmware. Encrypted boot is implemented
using a signed decryption stage prepended to a binary as a post-build step. Encrypted boot stores decryption keys in on-
device OTP memory, which can be locked down after use.
```
```
Point 3 allows applications to enforce internal security boundaries such that one part of an application being
compromised does not allow access to critical hardware, such as the voltage regulator or protected OTP storage used
for cryptographic keys.
Hardware features such as the glitch detector and redundancy coprocessor mitigate common classes of fault injection
attacks and help maintain boot integrity, even when an attacker has physical access.
```
#### 10.1.1. Secure boot

```
You can permanently alter blank RP2350 devices to restrict code execution to only your own code. With further
alteration, you can revoke the ability to run older software versions.
The RP2350 bootrom uses a cryptographic signature to distinguish authentic from inauthentic binaries. A signature is a
hash of the binary signed with the user’s private key. You can include signatures in binary images compiled for RP
devices. Signatures use the SHA-256 hash algorithm and secp256k1 ECDSA elliptic curve cipher to authenticate
binaries. The bootrom authenticates binaries using the following steps:
```
1. Calculate a SHA-256 hash using image code and data when loading the binary.
2. Verify the image’s signature using the user’s public key, which is also stored in the image.
3. Check the included, verified signature (from step 2) against the calculated SHA-256 hash value for the binary (from
    step 1).
4. Check the image’s public key against a SHA-256 key fingerprint stored in OTP.

```
If both checks succeed, the bootrom assumes someone in possession of the private key registered by an OTP public
key fingerprint calculated the same SHA-256 hash. Based on the properties of hash functions, the bootrom assumes
that the binary contents have not been altered since the signature was generated. This proves that this is an authentic
binary signed by the owner of the private key, so the bootrom will entertain the idea of running the binary.
The image may also have an anti-rollback version number (rollback.major.minor) that the bootrom checks against a
```
10.1. Overview (Arm) 816

```
counter stored in OTP. The bootrom refuses to boot images with rollback versions lower than the OTP counter number,
and automatically increments the OTP counter upon booting a higher version. This is useful if older binaries have known
vulnerabilities, as installing a newer version automatically revokes the ability to downgrade to older versions.
Incrementing the major and minor versions allows you to express a preference for newer, higher binary versions without
blocking execution of older, lower-versioned binaries. For more discussion of bootrom anti-rollback support, see Section
5.1.11.
```
```
RP2350 can boot from any of the following sources:
```
- Directly on external flash via execute-in-place (XIP)
- Loading into SRAM from external flash
- Loading into SRAM from user-specified OTP contents
- Loading into SRAM via USB or other serial bootloader
- Loading into SRAM via debugger
RP2350 enforces signatures on all of these boot media, with the exception of the debugger, when an external host has
control of RP2350’s processors and can completely skip execution of the bootrom. Disabling debug is part of the
secure boot enable procedure outlined in Section 10.5.
Although signatures can be enforced on a flash execute-in-place binary, we do not recommend it. With this boot media,
flash contents can change between checks and execution. For example, an attacker could emulate a QSPI device using
an FPGA or another microcontroller. Instead, load your complete application into SRAM and verify it in-place before
execution. RP2350 has sufficient SRAM capacity to do this with most applications.
Pure-software secure boot implementations are susceptible to fault injection attacks when an attacker has physical
access to the device, as is often the case for embedded hardware. Our very own Pico is a popular tool for voltage fault
injection. Instead of potentially booting an unauthorised binary, the RP2350 glitch detectors (Section 10.9) and
redundancy coprocessor (Section 3.6.3) mitigate fault injection attacks by detecting out-of-envelope operation and
bringing the system to a safe halt. To enable the glitch detectors, set the CRIT1.GLITCH_DETECTOR_ENABLE OTP flag.
The redundancy coprocessor is always used by the bootrom.
To learn more about how to enable secure boot on a blank RP2350 device, see Section 10.5.

#### 10.1.2. Encrypted boot

```
RP2350 contains 8 kB of OTP, which can be protected at 128-byte page granularity. This protection comes in the
following forms:
```
- hard locks, which permanently revoke read or write access by Secure or Non-secure code
- soft locks, which revoke permissions only until the next reset of the OTP block.
Encrypted boot stores decryption keys in OTP, and protects the keys from later boot stages using soft locks.
RP2350 supports loading encrypted binaries from external flash into SRAM, which can then decrypt their own contents
in-place. Many implementations are possible, but as a concrete example, this section describes the flash-resident binary
encryption support provided by the SDK and picotool.
1. First, the developer should process a plain SRAM binary into an encrypted binary. To encrypt your binary, the SDK
completes the following steps after a build:
a. Sign the payload binary using the boot private key, if you didn’t already do this during the build.

```
b. Encrypt the payload binary using the encryption key (not the private key).
c. Append a small decryption stage to the binary that contains a modified copy of the payload’s IMAGE_DEF (the
original is unreadable, as it is encrypted).
```
```
d. Sign the decryption stage together with the encrypted contents, using the boot private key.
Encrypted binaries boot as packaged RAM binaries (Section 5.1.10), decrypting themselves in-place. To boot an
```
10.1. Overview (Arm) 817

```
encrypted binary, the bootrom completes the following steps:
```
1. Loads the entire encrypted binary into SRAM.
2. Verifies the signature of the decryption stage, then jumps into the decryption stage, comprised of the following
    steps:
       a. Reads the decryption key stored in OTP (this stage may soft-lock that OTP page until next boot).
b. Decrypts the encrypted binary payload using the decryption key.

```
c. Calls the chain_image() bootrom API (Section 5.4.8.2) on the decrypted region of SRAM.
```
3. Verifies the decrypted binary payload in the same manner as it verified the decryption stage, then jumps into the
    binary.
The decryption stage is not itself encrypted, but it is signed. Storing the decryption stage in the clear does not present
additional risk because the source code for the decryption stage is open source and highly scrutinised. Without the
decryption key, the encrypted payload cannot be read. Because the key only exists on-device, static analysis of the
encrypted binary cannot recover it.

```
Resetting the OTP to reopen soft locks also resets the processors. Upon reset, the processors re-run the decryption
stage and re-lock the page with the decryption key. The BOOTDIS register allows the bootrom to detect OTP resets and
disable the watchdog and POWMAN boot vectors. This ensures that the decryption stage is not skipped and the key
remains protected.
```
#####  NOTE

```
The decryption stage is deliberately not included in the bootrom, so that it can be updated. The bootrom handles
only public key cryptography, so there is no concern of power analysis attacks, but this reasoning does not apply to
the decryption stage. Power analysis mitigations require iteration as techniques improve.
```
```
This scheme supports designs where the decryption key is accessible only to the decryption stage. When the decryption
key is also required at runtime to read additional encrypted flash contents on-demand, processor security features and
OTP page locks can restrict key access to a small subset of trusted code, such as a TF-M Secure Storage service.
```
```
In addition to software mitigations provided by the decryption stage, RP2350 supports randomising the frequency
controls of its internal ring oscillator (Section 8.3) to make it more difficult to recover the system clock from power
traces.
```
```
Encrypted execute-in-place is not supported in hardware, but the spare 32 MB cached XIP window (Section 4.4.1) can
provide software-defined execute-in-place by trapping cache misses and pinning at the miss address. This may be used
to transparently decrypt data on-demand from external flash.
```
#### 10.1.3. Isolating trusted and untrusted doftware

```
In security- or safety-critical applications, access must be limited to those who need it. For example, a JPEG decode
library should not be able to access the core voltage regulator and increase DVDD to 3.3 V (unless you are
decompressing a very large JPEG). The Cortex-M33 processors contain hardware that separates two execution
contexts, known as Secure and Non-secure, and enforces a number of invariants between them, such as:
```
- Non-secure code cannot access Secure memory
- The Secure context cannot execute Non-secure memory
- Non-secure code cannot directly access peripherals managed by Secure code
- Non-secure code cannot prevent Secure interrupts from being serviced
By making less of your code able to access your most critical hardware and data, you reduce the chance of accidentally
exposing this critical hardware and data to the outside world. For a high-level explanation of how the Cortex-M
implements this, see Section 10.2. For full details, see Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual.

10.1. Overview (Arm) 818

```
To make the programming model of Secure and Non-secure software consistent, and to avoid overhead in Non-secure
code, RP2350 extends Secure/Non-secure separation throughout the system. For example, DMA channels can be
assigned for Secure or Non-secure use. Using this extended separation, Non-secure code can use DMA transfers to
accelerate peripheral accesses without endangering security model invariants (such as Non-secure code using the DMA
to read Secure memory).
The key hardware features that enable Secure/Non-secure separation throughout the system are:
```
- The Cortex-M33’s implementation of the Secure and Non-secure states (Section 10.2)
- The DMA’s implementation of matching per-channel security states (Section 10.7)
- The system-level bus access filtering implemented by ACCESSCTRL (Section 10.6)
- Peripheral-level filtering, such as the per-GPIO access filtering of the SIO GPIO registers (Section 3.1.1)

## 10.2. Processor security features (Arm)

```
The Cortex-M33 processors on RP2350 are configured with the following standard Arm security features:
```
- Support for the Armv8-M Security extension
- 8 ×^ security attribution unit (SAU) regions
- 8 ×^ Secure and 8×^ Non-secure memory protection unit (MPU) regions
These features are covered exhaustively in the Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual, the Cortex-M33 Technical
Reference Manual, and the Cortex-M33 section of this datasheet (Section 3.7). This section gives a high-level overview
of these features, as well as a description of the implementation-defined attribution unit included in RP2350.

#### 10.2.1. Background

```
The Cortex-M33 processors on RP2350 support the Armv8-M Security Extension. Hardware in the processor maintains
two separate execution contexts, called the Secure and Non-secure domains. Access to important data, such as
cryptographic keys, or hardware, such as the system voltage regulator, can be limited to the Secure domain. Separating
execution into these domains prevents Non-secure execution from interfering with Secure execution. When this
datasheet uses the (capitalised) terms Secure and Non-secure, we refer to these two Arm security domains and the
associated bus attributes.
```
```
Code running in the Non-secure domain is not necessarily malicious. Consider complex protocols and stacks like USB,
whose implementation is expected to be easily-exploited and prone to fatal crashes. Restricting such software to the
Non-secure domain helps isolate critical software from the consequences of those design decisions. The RP
bootrom, for example, runs all of its USB code in the Non-secure domain so the USB code does not have to be
considered in the design of critical parts of the bootrom, such as boot signature enforcement.
```
```
At any given moment, an Armv8-M processor implementing the Security Extension is in either the Secure execution
state or the Non-secure execution state. Based on the current state, the processor limits the executable memory
regions and the memory regions accessible via load/store instructions. All of the processor’s AHB accesses are tagged
according to the state that originated them, so that peripherals and the system bus fabric itself can filter transfers
based on security domain, for example, using the access control lists described in Section 10.6.
```
```
An internal processor peripheral called the Security Attribution Unit (SAU) defines, from the processor’s point of view,
which address ranges are accessible to the Secure and Non-secure domains. The number of distinct address ranges
which can be decoded by the SAU is limited, which is why system-level bus filters are provided for assigning peripherals
to security domains.
The processor changes security state synchronously using special function calls between states. When an interrupt
routed to the Secure domain occurs, the processor can also change security state asynchronously if in the Non-secure
state, or vice versa (if enabled).
```
```
Both Cortex-M33 processors on RP2350 implement the security extension, so each processor maintains its own Secure
```
10.2. Processor security features (Arm) 819

```
and Non-secure context. The Secure and Non-secure contexts on each core can communicate, for example using
shared memory or the Secure/Non-secure SIO mailbox FIFOs. If the cores are used symmetrically (i.e. a shared dual-
core Secure context, and a shared dual-core Non-secure context), software must synchronise the processor SAUs so
that memory writable from a Non-secure context on one core is not executable in a Secure context on the other core.
The DMA MPU, which supports the same region shape and count as the SAU, must also be kept synchronised with the
processor SAUs.
```
```
It may be simpler to use the cores asymmetrically, implementing all Secure services on one core only. The
FORCE_CORE_NS register can make all core 1 accesses appear Non-secure on the system bus, for the purpose of
security filtering implemented in the fabric and peripherals, as well as for SIO registers banked over Secure/Non-secure.
However, this does not affect PPB accesses. This does not affect core 1 internally, so it can still maintain its own
Secure/Non-secure context. However, system hardware will consider all core 1 accesses Non-secure.
```
#### 10.2.2. IDAU address map

```
The Cortex-M33 provides an implementation-defined attribution unit (IDAU) interface, which allows system
implementers such as Raspberry Pi Ltd to augment the security attribution map defined by the SAU. The RP2350 IDAU
is a hardwired address decode network, with no user configuration. Its address map is as follows:
```
```
Start (hex) End (hex) Contents IDAU Attribute
00000000 000042ff Arm boot Exempt
```
```
00004300 00007dff USB/RISC-V boot Non-secure (instruction fetch), Exempt (load/store)
00007e00 00007fff Bootrom SGs Secure and Non-secure-Callable
```
```
10000000 1fffffff XIP Non-secure
```
```
20000000 20081fff SRAM Non-secure
```
```
40000000 4fffffff APB Exempt
50000000 5fffffff AHB Exempt
```
```
d0000000 dfffffff SIO Exempt
```
```
Exempt regions are not checked by the processor against its current security state. Effectively, the processor considers
these regions Secure when the processor is in the Secure state, and Non-secure when the processor is in the Non-
secure state.
Peripherals are marked Exempt because you’re expected to assign them to security domains using the controls in
ACCESSCTRL (Section 10.6). This approach avoids relying on SAU regions, which are too limited for meaningful
peripheral assignment, and eliminates the need for separate Secure and Non-secure peripheral mirrors, which can
cause programming errors.
```
```
The SIO is marked Exempt because it is internally banked over Secure and Non-secure based on the bus access’s
security attribute, which generally matches the processor’s current security state.
```
```
As peripherals are Exempt, RP2350 forbids processor instruction fetch from peripherals, by physically disconnecting the
bus. Processors fail to fetch instructions from peripherals even if the default MPU permissions are overridden to allow
execute permission. Exempt regions permit both Secure and Non-secure access, and TrustZone-M forbids the
combination of Non-secure-writable and Secure-executable, so this is a necessary restriction. The same consideration
does not apply to the bootrom as the ROM is physically immutable.
```
```
The first part of the bootrom is Exempt, because it contains routines expected to be called by both Secure and Non-
secure software in cases where it may not be desirable for Non-secure code to elevate through a Secure Gateway. An
example of this is the bootrom memcpy() implementation. Code in the Exempt ROM region is hardened against return-
oriented programming (ROP) attacks using the redundancy coprocessor’s stack canary instructions.
After a certain watermark, which may vary depending on ROM revision, the ROM becomes IDAU-Non-secure for the
purpose of instruction fetch. If an Non-secure SAU region is placed over the bootrom (which is expected to be the case
```
10.2. Processor security features (Arm) 820

```
in general, to get the correct NSC attribute on the Secure Gateway region), this part of the ROM becomes non-
executable to Secure code. Consequently, this part of the bootrom is not ROP-hardened. This part of the ROM contains
the NSBOOT (including USB boot) implementation, as well as a RISC-V Armv6-M emulator that can be used to emulate
most of the bootrom on RISC-V processors. This region is only implemented on the instruction-side IDAU query: this is
an implementation detail that improves timing on the load/store IDAU query, and does not have security implications
(given the mask ROM is inherently unwritable) other than that the tt instruction will not be aware of this region.
```
```
The final 512 bytes of the bootrom has the Secure, Non-secure-Callable (NSC) attribute. This means it contains entry
points for Non-secure calls into Secure code. Note that for this IDAU-defined attribute to take effect, the SAU-defined
attribute for this range must also be NSC or lower. The recommended configuration is a single Non-secure SAU region
covering the entirety of the bootrom. The bootrom exits into user code with the SAU enabled, and SAU region 7 active
and covering the entirety of the bootrom.
```
```
XIP and SRAM are Non-secure in the IDAU, as they are expected to be divided using the SAU. When the SAU and IDAU
differ, if the IDAU attribute is not Exempt, the processor takes whichever is greater out of the SAU and IDAU attribute, in
the order Secure > Non-secure-Callable > Non-secure.
Addresses not listed in this table are not decoded by the system AHB crossbar, and will return bus faults if accessed. In
these ranges, the ROM’s IDAU map is mirrored every 32 kB up to 0x0fffffff. The remaining addresses in the IDAU are
Non-secure.
```
## 10.3. Overview (RISC-V)

```
The RP2350 bootrom does not implement secure boot for RISC-V processors. Secure flash boot can still be
implemented on RISC-V by storing secure boot code in OTP and disabling other boot media via the BOOT_FLAGS0 row
in OTP. However, this is not supported natively by the RP2350 bootrom.
The RISC-V processors on RP2350 implement Machine and User execution modes, and the standard Physical Memory
Protection unit (PMP), which can be used to enforce internal security or safety boundaries. See Section 10.4.
Non-processor-specific hardware security features, such as debug disable OTP flags and the glitch detectors, are
functionally identically between Arm and RISC-V. However, the redundancy coprocessor (RCP) is not accessible from
the RISC-V processors, as it uses a Cortex-M33-specific coprocessor interface.
```
## 10.4. Processor security features (RISC-V)

```
The Hazard3 processors on RP2350 implement the following standard RISC-V security features:
```
- Machine and User execution modes (M-mode and U-mode)
- The Physical Memory Protection unit (PMP)
M-mode has full access to the processor’s internal status registers, but U-mode does not. The processor’s bus
accesses are tagged with its current execution mode and filtered by ACCESSCTRL bus filters, as described in Section
10.6.2.
The processor starts in M-mode, and enters M-mode upon taking any trap (exception or interrupt). It enters U-mode only
by executing a return-from-M-mode instruction, mret, with previous privilege set to U-mode. This means all interrupts
initially target M-mode, but can be de-privileged to U-mode via software routing. Because stacks are software-managed
on RISC-V, software cooperation is required to fully separate the two execution contexts, though there are enough
hardware hooks to make this possible. For more details about interrupts and exceptions on RISC-V, and how they relate
to the core’s privilege levels, see Section 3.8.4.

```
The PMP is a memory protection unit built into each RISC-V processor that filters every instruction execution address
and every load/store address against a list of permission regions. The Hazard3 instances on RP2350 are configured
with 8 PMP regions each, with a 32-byte granule and naturally-aligned power-of-2 region support only.
```
```
Additionally, there are 3 PMP-hardwired regions, which set a default User-mode RW permission on peripherals and a
```
10.3. Overview (RISC-V) 821

```
User-mode RWX permission on the ROM. These are assigned region numbers 8 through 10. Because lower-numbered
regions always take precedence, any dynamically-configured region can override these hardwired regions.
There are many more peripherals than PMP regions. In typical use-cases, the programmer assigns these peripherals
blanket U-mode RW permissions. Because hardwired regions are much cheaper than dynamically-configured regions, it
was more efficient to use hardwired regions. These regions are included because the peripherals are expected to be
assigned using ACCESSCTRL, rather than PMP. The hardwired regions play a similar role to the Exempt regions in the
RP2350 Cortex-M IDAU.
Together with the ACCESSCTRL filters, these PMP regions are an effective mechanism for partitioning between
addresses accessible from U-mode and addresses not accessible from U-mode. Hazard3 includes one custom PMP
feature, the PMPCFGM0 register, which allows the PMP to set M-mode permissions as well as U-mode without locking.
This is useful for preventing accidental (but not deliberate) access to a memory region.
```
## 10.5. Secure boot enable procedure

```
To enable secure boot:
```
1. Program at least one public key fingerprint into OTP, starting at BOOTKEY0_0.
2. Mark programmed keys as valid by programming BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_VALID.
3. Optionally, mark unused keys as invalid by programming BOOT_FLAGS1.KEY_INVALID — this is recommended to
    prevent a malicious actor installing their own boot keys at a later date.

### ◦ KEY_INVALID^ takes precedence over^ KEY_VALID, which prevents more keys from being added later.

### ◦ Program^ KEY_INVALID^ with additional bits to revoke keys at a later time.

4. Disable debugging by programming CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE, CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE, or installing a
    debug key (Section 3.5.9.2).
5. Optionally, enable the glitch detector (Section 10.9) by programming CRIT1.GLITCH_DETECTOR_ENABLE and
    setting the desired sensitivity in CRIT1.GLITCH_DETECTOR_SENS.
6. Disable unused boot options such as USB and UART boot in BOOT_FLAGS0.
7. Enable secure boot, by programming CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE.

#####  WARNING

```
This procedure is irreversible. Before programming, ensure that you are using the correct public key, correctly
hashed. picotool supports programming keys into OTP from standard PEM files, performing the fingerprint hashing
automatically. Programming the wrong key will make it impossible to run code on your device.
```
## 10.6. Access control

```
The access control registers (ACCESSCTRL) define permissions required to access GPIOs and bus endpoints such as
peripherals and memory devices.
For each bus endpoint (for example, PIO0), a bus access control register such as PIO0 controls which AHB5 managers
can access it, and at which bus security levels. This register has further implications, such as access to the RESETS
controls for that block. For a full explanation of the bus access control registers, see Section 10.6.2.
```
```
For each GPIO, including the QSPI and USB DP/DM pins, a bit in the GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1 register can
be set to make that GPIO accessible to both the Secure and Non-secure domains, or clear to make it Secure-only. This
has system-wide implications, controlling:
```
- GPIO visibility to the Non-secure SIO

10.5. Secure boot enable procedure 822

- Non-secure code access to that GPIO’s IO muxing and pad control registers
- GPIO selection access to peripherals accessible only via Secure bus access

ACCESSCTRL registers are always fully readable by the processors in any security or privilege state, so that Non-secure
software can enumerate the hardware it is allowed to access. However, writes to ACCESSCTRL are strictly controlled.
Unprivileged writes, and writes from the DMA, return a bus fault. Writes from a Non-secure, Privileged (NSP) context are
generally ignored, with the sole exception of the Non-secure, Unprivileged (NSU) bits in bus access control registers. The
NSU bits are Non-secure-writable if and only if the NSP bit is set.

Writes can be further locked down using the LOCK register. This causes writes from specific managers to be ignored.

For a full list of effects, see Section 10.6.1.

To reduce the risk of accidental writes, all ACCESSCTRL registers, except GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1, require
the 16-bit value 0xacce to be present in the most-significant 16 bits of the write data. To achieve this, OR the value
0xacce0000 with your write data. Atomic SET/CLR/XOR alias writes must also include this value. DMA writes are also
forbidden, to avoid accidentally wiping permissions with a misconfigured DMA channel.

#####  IMPORTANT

```
Writes with the upper 16 bits not equal to 0xacce both fail and return a bus fault (instead of silently leaving the
permissions unchanged).
```
Finally, the FORCE_CORE_NS register makes core 1’s bus accesses appear to be Non-secure at system level. This
supports schemes where all Secure services run on core 0, and therefore core 1 should not be able to access Secure
hardware.

#### 10.6.1. GPIO access control

The GPIO Non-secure access mask registers, GPIO_NSMASK0 and GPIO_NSMASK1, contain one bit per GPIO. The
layout of these two registers matches the layout of the SIO GPIO registers (Section 3.1.3), including the positions of the
QSPI and USB DM/DP bits. Each GPIO is accessible to Non-secure software if and only if the relevant GPIO_NSMASK bit is
set. This prevents Non-secure software from interfering with or observing GPIOs used by Secure software.

All system-level GPIO controls, such as the IO and pad control registers, are shared by Secure and Non-secure code.
However, access to these registers is filtered on a GPIO-by-GPIO basis according to the GPIO_NSMASK registers. This
means that the same code can run unmodified in either a Secure or Non-secure context, and Secure software does not
have to implement any interfaces for Non-secure GPIO access, provided that the appropriate GPIO security mask has
been configured.

Setting a GPIO_NSMASK bit has the following effects on the corresponding GPIO:

- The relevant SIO GPIO register bit (Section 3.1.3) becomes accessible through bus access to the Non-secure SIO.

### ◦ Otherwise the bit is read-only zero.

- The relevant SIO GPIO register bit becomes accessible to Non-secure code using GPIO coprocessor instructions
    (Section 3.6.1).

### ◦ Otherwise the bit is read-only zero.

### ◦ Non-secure code may execute GPIO coprocessor instructions if and only if coprocessor^0 is granted to Non-

```
secure in NSACR, and enabled in the Non-secure PPB instance of the CPACR register.
```
- The relevant IO control register (Section 9.11.1 or Section 9.11.2) becomes accessible to Non-secure code.

### ◦ Otherwise it is read-only zero.

- GPIO functions for Secure-only peripherals can not be selected on this GPIO

### ◦ Attempting to select such a peripheral will select the null function (0x1f) instead

### ◦ If a Secure-only peripheral is selected at the time that this GPIO is made Non-secure-accessible, then the

```
selection will be changed to the null function.
```
- The relevant pad control register (Section 9.11.3 or Section 9.11.4) becomes accessible to Non-secure code.

### ◦ Otherwise it is read-only zero.

- Interrupts for this GPIO are routed to the Non-secure GPIO interrupts,^ IO_IRQ_BANK0_NS^ and^ IO_IRQ_QSPI_NS, rather than
    the default Secure interrupts, IO_IRQ_BANK0 and IO_IRQ_QSPI. (See Section 3.2 for the system IRQ listing.)
- The relevant GPIO interrupt control and status bits, e.g. PROC0_INTS0, become accessible to Non-secure code.

### ◦ Otherwise they are read-only zero.

- The GPIO can be read by PIO instances which are Non-secure-accessible.

### ◦ Otherwise it reads as zero.

### ◦ Like the SIO, PIO can observe GPIOs even when not function-selected, so additional logic masks Secure-only

```
GPIOs from Non-secure-accessible PIO instances
```
#####  NOTE

```
Due to RP2350-E3, on RP2350A (QFN-60), access to the PADS_BANK0 registers is controlled by the wrong bits of
GPIO_NSMASK. On QFN-60 you must disable Non-secure access to the pads registers, and implement a software
interface for Non-secure code to manipulate its assigned PADS registers.
```
#### 10.6.2. Bus access control

The bus access control registers define which combinations of Secure/Non-secure and Privileged/Unprivileged are
permitted to access each downstream bus port. This mechanism also assigns peripherals to security domains.
Additionally, the bus access control registers define which upstream sources (processor 0/1, DMA or debugger) are
permitted.

Hardware filters on the system bus (Section 2.1) check each access against the permission list for its destination. The
filter shoots down accesses which do not meet the criteria specified in ACCESSCTRL register for that destination; the
access does not reach its destination, and instead a bus error is returned directly from the bus fabric. There is no effect
on the destination register, and no data is returned. Bus errors result in an exception on the offending processor, or an
error flag raised on the offending DMA channel.

There are 8 bits in each register (for example the ADC register). The SP, SU, NSP and NSU bits correspond to the processor
security state from which a bus transfer originated, or the security level of the originating DMA channel:

- The^ SP^ bit allows access from:

### ◦ Privileged software running in the Secure domain on an Arm processor

### ◦ Machine-mode software on a RISC-V processor

### ◦ A DMA channel with a security level of^ SP^ (3)

- The^ SU^ bit must be set, in addition to the^ SP^ bit, to allow access from:

### ◦ User (unprivileged) software running in the Secure domain on an Arm processor

### ◦ A DMA channel with a security level of^ SU^ (2)

- The^ NSP^ bit allow access from:

### ◦ Privileged software running in the Non-secure domain on an Arm processor

### ◦ Privileged Arm software running in the Secure domain on core 1, when FORCE_CORE_NS.CORE1 is set

### ◦ Machine-mode RISC-V software running on core 1, when FORCE_CORE_NS.CORE1 is set

### ◦ A DMA channel with a security level of^ NSP^ (1)

- The^ NSU^ bit must be set, in addition to the^ NSP^ bit, to allow access from:

### ◦ User (unprivileged) software running in the Non-secure domain on an Arm processor

### ◦ User (unprivileged) Arm software running on core 1 when FORCE_CORE_NS.CORE1 is set

### ◦ User-mode software on a RISC-V processor

### ◦ A DMA channel with a security level of^ NSU^ (0)

#####  NOTE

```
The security/privilege of AHB Mem-AP accesses are configurable, and have the same bus security/privilege level as
load/stores from the corresponding security/privilege context on that processor. There is one AHB Mem-AP for each
Arm processor.
```
#####  NOTE

```
RISC-V Debug-mode memory accesses have the same bus security/privilege level as Machine-mode software
running on that processor, and RISC-V System Bus Access through the Debug Module has the same bus
security/privilege level as Machine-mode software running on core 1.
```
The DBG, DMA, CORE1 and CORE0 bits must be set in addition to the relevant security/privilege bits, in order to allow access
from a particular bus manager. The DBG bit corresponds to any of:

- Accesses from either Arm processor’s AHB Mem-AP
- Accesses from either RISC-V core in Debug mode
- Accesses from RISC-V System Bus Access

Separating debug access controls from software-driven processor access means that, even with software locked out of
a register block, the developer may still be able to access that block from the debugger.

Most bus access permission bits are Secure, Privileged-writable only. The sole exception is the NSU bit, which is also
writable from a Non-secure, Privileged context if and only if the NSP bit in the same register is set. The intention is that
once the Secure domain has granted Non-secure access, it is then up to Non-secure software to decide whether to
grant Unprivileged access within the Non-secure domain.

##### 10.6.2.1. Default permissions

Most bus endpoints default to Secure access only, from any master, but there are exceptions. The following default to
fully open access (any combination of security/privilege) from any master (for example, because they are expected to
be divided up by the processors' internal memory protection hardware):

- Boot ROM (Section 4.1)
- XIP (Section 4.4)
- SRAM (Section 4.2)
- SYSINFO (Section 12.15.1)

The following default to Secure, Privileged access (SP) only, from any manager:

- XIP_AUX (DMA FIFOs) (Section 4.4.3)
- SHA-256 (Section 12.13)

The following default to Secure, Privileged access (SP) only, with DMA access forbidden by default:

- POWMAN (Chapter 6), which includes power management and voltage regulator control registers
- True random number generator (Section 12.12)

- Clock control registers (Section 8.1)
- XOSC (Section 8.2)
- ROSC (Section 8.3)
- SYSCFG (Section 12.15.2)
- PLLs (Section 8.6)
- Tick generators (Section 8.5)
- Watchdog (Section 12.9)
- PSM (Section 7.4)
- XIP control registers (Section 4.4.5)
- QMI (Section 12.14)
- CoreSight trace DMA FIFO
- CoreSight self-hosted debug window

Any bus endpoint not in any of the above lists defaults to Secure access only, from any manager,

##### 10.6.2.2. Other effects of bus permissions

To avoid contradictory configurations such as a Secure-only peripheral being selected on a Non-secure-accessible
GPIO, and to improve portability between Secure and Non-secure software, the bus access permission lists propagate
to certain other system-level hardware:

- The reset controls for a given peripheral in the RESETS block (Section 7.5) are Non-secure-accessible if and only if
    the peripheral itself is Non-secure-accessible.

### ◦ Non-secure access to the RESETS block itself must also be granted via the RESETS bus access register.

- Non-secure-inaccessible peripherals cannot be function-selected on Non-secure-accessible GPIOs. Attempting to
    do so selects the null GPIO function (0x1f).
- PIO blocks which are accessible to Non-secure, and those which are not, can not perform cross-PIO operations
    such as observing each other’s interrupt flags.
- PIO blocks which are accessible to Non-secure can not read Secure-only GPIOs.
- DMA channels below the least-set effective permission bit (ignoring^ SU^ when^ SP^ is clear, and ignoring^ NSU^ when^ NSP
    is clear) are disconnected from that peripheral’s DREQ signals.

##### 10.6.2.3. Blocks without bus access control

There are four memory-mapped blocks which do not have bus access control registers in ACCESSCTRL:

- The Cortex-M PPB is internal to the processors, and is banked internally over Secure/Non-secure.
- The SIO is also banked internally over Secure/Non-secure access.
- ACCESSCTRL itself is always world-readable and has its own internal filtering for writes.
- Boot RAM is hardwired for Secure access only.

#### 10.6.3. List of registers

The ACCESSCTRL registers start at a base address of 0x40060000 (defined as ACCESSCTRL_BASE in the SDK).

```
Offset Name Info
```
```
0x00 LOCK Once a LOCK bit is written to 1, ACCESSCTRL silently ignores
writes from that master. LOCK is writable only by a Secure,
Privileged processor or debugger.
```
```
LOCK bits are only writable when their value is zero. Once set,
they can never be cleared, except by a full reset of ACCESSCTRL
```
```
Setting the LOCK bit does not affect whether an access raises a
bus error. Unprivileged writes, or writes from the DMA, will
continue to raise bus errors. All other accesses will continue not
to.
0x04 FORCE_CORE_NS Force core 1’s bus accesses to always be Non-secure, no matter
the core’s internal state.
```
```
Useful for schemes where one core is designated as the Non-
secure core, since some peripherals may filter individual
registers internally based on security state but not on master ID.
```
```
0x08 CFGRESET Write 1 to reset all ACCESSCTRL configuration, except for the
LOCK and FORCE_CORE_NS registers.
```
```
This bit is used in the RP2350 bootrom to quickly restore
ACCESSCTRL to a known state during the boot path.
```
```
Note that, like all registers in ACCESSCTRL, this register is not
writable when the writer’s corresponding LOCK bit is set,
therefore a master which has been locked out of ACCESSCTRL
can not use the CFGRESET register to disturb its contents.

## 10.7. DMA

```
The RP2350 system DMA is a peripheral which performs arbitrary reads and writes on memory. This means that, as
with a processor, care is necessary to maintain isolation between memory or peripherals owned by different security
domains. Any given processor context must not access memory or peripherals belonging to a more secure context. The
DMA helps maintain this invariant by ensuring software can not use the DMA to access a more secure context on its
behalf, including such cases as a processor programming the DMA to program the DMA.
```
```
RP2350 extends the processor security/privilege states to individual DMA channels, and the DMA filters its own
memory accesses with a built-in memory protection unit (MPU) similarly capable to the Armv8-M SAU or the RISC-V
PMP. When correctly configured, this allows multiple security domains to transparently and safely share DMA
```
###### 10.7. DMA 867

```
resources. It is also possible to assign the entire DMA block wholesale to a single security domain using the
ACCESSCTRL registers (Section 10.6) if this fine-grained configuration is not desired.
This section gives an overview of the DMA’s security features. The specific hardware details are documented in Section
12.6.6.
```
#### 10.7.1. Channel security attributes

```
Each channel is assigned a security level using the per-channel registers starting at SECCFG_CH0. This defines:
```
- The minimum privilege required to configure and control the channel, or observe its status
- The bus privilege at which the channel performs its memory accesses
For the sake of comparing security levels, the DMA assigns the following total order to AHB5 security/privilege
attributes: Secure + Privileged > Secure + Unprivileged > Non-secure + Privileged > Non-secure + Unprivileged.

```
A channel’s security level can be changed freely up until any of the channel’s control registers is written. After this point,
its security level is locked, and cannot be changed until the DMA block resets. At reset, all channels become Secure +
Privileged (security level = 3, the maximum).
```
```
The effects of the channel SECCFG registers are listed exhaustively in the relevant DMA documentation, Section 12.6.6.1.
```
#### 10.7.2. Memory protection unit

```
The RP2350 DMA features a memory protection unit that you can configure to set the security/privilege level required to
access up to eight different address ranges, plus a default level for addresses not matched by any of those eight
ranges. The addresses of all DMA reads and writes are checked against the MPU address map. If the originating
channel’s security level is lower than that defined in the address map, the access is filtered. A filtered access has no
effect on the downstream bus, and returns a bus error to the offending channel.
```
```
The DMA memory protection unit is configured by DMA control registers starting from MPU_CTRL. See Section 12.6.6.3
for more details.
```
#### 10.7.3. DREQ attributes

```
Channels are not permitted to interface with the DREQs of peripherals above their security level, as determined by the
peripheral access controls in ACCESSCTRL. This is done to avoid any information being inferred from the timing of
secure peripheral transfers, and because the clear handshake on the RP2040 DREQ can be used maliciously to cause a
Secure DMA channel to overflow its destination FIFO and corrupt/lose data (for details about the DREQ handshake, see
Section 12.6.4.2).
The DREQ security levels are driven by the ACCESSCTRL block access registers. ACCESSCTRL takes the index of the
least-significant set bit in the 4-bit permission mask, having first ANDed the SP into SU, and NSP into SU. This creates a 2-
bit integer which is compared with the DMA channel’s security level to determine whether it can interface with this
DREQ.
```
#### 10.7.4. IRQ attributes

```
Each of the four shared DMA interrupt lines (IRQs) has a configurable security level. The IRQ’s security level is
compared with channel security levels, and with the bus privilege of accesses to the DMA’s interrupt control registers, to
determine:
```
- Whether a bus access is permitted to read/write the^ INTE/INTF/INTS^ registers for this IRQ
- Whether a given channel will be visible in this IRQ’s^ INTS^ register (and therefore whether that channel will cause

###### 10.7. DMA 868

```
assertion of this IRQ)
```
- Whether a given channel can have its interrupt pending flag set/cleared via this IRQ’s INTF/INTS registers
For a bus access to view/configure an IRQ, it must have a security level greater than or equal to the IRQ’s security level.
For an IRQ to observe a channel’s interrupt pending flag, the IRQ must have a security level greater than or equal to the
channel’s security level. Consequently, for a bus to observe a channel’s interrupt status, the bus access security level
must be greater than or equal to the channel’s security level.

```
For an IRQ to observe a channel’s interrupt pending flag, it must have a security level greater than or equal to the
channel’s security level.
```
```
There is only one INTR register. Which channels' interrupts can be observed and cleared through INTR is determined by
comparing channel security levels to the security level of the INTR bus access.
```
## 10.8. OTP

```
RP2350 contains 8 kB of OTP storage, organised as 4096 × 24-bit rows with hardware ECC protection. This is the only
mutable, on-die, non-volatile storage. Boot signing keys and decryption keys are stored in OTP, and as such it is a vital
part of the security architecture. This section gives a brief summary of OTP hardware protection features; Chapter 13
documents the hardware in full.
```
```
The RP2350 OTP subystem adds a hardware layer on top of the OTP storage array, to protect sensitive contents:
```
- OTP is protected at a 128-byte page granularity (see Section 13.5)

### ◦ Each page can be fully accessible, read-only, or fully inacessible

### ◦ Locks are defined separately for Secure, Non-secure and bootloader access

### ◦ Programming OTP lock locations starting at PAGE0_LOCK0 applies locks permanently

### ◦ Writing to registers starting at SW_LOCK0 advances locks to a less-permissive state until the next OTP reset

- OTP control registers used to access the SBPI interface are hardwired for Secure access only

### ◦ The SBPI interface is used to program the OTP and configure power supply and analogue hardware

- The guarded read aliases provide higher assurance against deliberate OTP power supply manipulation during
    reads (Section 13.1.1)
- Hardware reads the OTP array at startup for security hardware configuration (Section 13.3.4)

### ◦ The critical flags (Section 13.4) enable secure boot, enable the glitch detectors, and disable debug

### ◦ The OTP hardware access keys (Section 13.5.2) provide further protection for OTP pages

### ◦ The debug keys (Section 3.5.9.2) are an additional mechanism to conditionally lock down debug access

```
OTP also contains configuration for the RP2350 bootrom, particularly its secure boot implementation. Section 13.10
lists all predefined OTP data locations. Boot configuration is stored in page 1, starting from BOOT_FLAGS0.
The bootrom can load and run code stored in OTP; see the bootrom documentation in Section 5.10.7, and the OTP data
listings starting from OTPBOOT_SRC. When secure boot is enabled, code loaded from OTP is subject to all of the usual
requirements for image signing and versioning, so this code can form part of your secure boot chain. The chain_image()
ROM API allows your OTP-resident bootloader to call back into the ROM to verify the next boot stage that it has loaded.
```
## 10.9. Glitch detector

```
The glitch detector detects loss of setup and hold margin in the system clock domain, which may be caused by
deliberate external manipulation of the system clock or core supply voltage. When it detects loss, the glitch detector
triggers a system reset rather than allowing software to continue to execute in a possibly undefined state. It responds
```
###### 10.8. OTP 869

```
within one system clock cycle, unlike the brownout detector, which has much more limited analog bandwidth.
The glitch detector is disabled by default, and can be armed by setting the GLITCH_DETECTOR_ENABLE flag in OTP. For
debugging purposes, you can also enable the glitch detector via the ARM register. This is not recommended in security-
sensitive applications, as the system is vulnerable until the point that software can enable the detectors.
```
#### 10.9.1. Theory of operation

```
The glitch detector is comprised of four identical detector circuits, based on a pair of D flip-flops. These detector
circuits are each placed in different, physically distant locations within the core voltage domain.
```
Figure 43. Glitch
detector trigger
circuit. Two flops each
toggle on every
system clock cycle.
One has a
programmable delay
line in its feedback
path, the other does
not. Loss of setup or
hold margin causes
one of the flops to fail
to toggle, so the flops
values differ, setting
the trigger output.

```
The detector triggers when the two D-flops take on different values, which is impossible under normal circumstances.
The delay line is programmable from 75% to 120% of the minimum system clock period in increments of 15%. Higher
delays make the circuit more sensitive to loss of setup margin. To configure initial sensitivity, use the
GLITCH_DETECTOR_SENS OTP flags. You can fine-tune sensitivity for each detector using the SENSITIVITY register.
```
```
Because the circuit is constructed from digital standard cells, it closely tracks the changes in propagation delay to
nearby cells caused by voltage and temperature fluctuations. Therefore the delay line’s propagation delay is specified
as a fraction of the maximum system clock data path delay, rather than a fixed time in nanoseconds.
```
#### 10.9.2. Trigger response

```
When any of the detectors fires, the corresponding bit in the TRIG_STATUS is set. If the glitch detector block is armed,
this detector event also resets almost all logic in the switched core domain. The glitch detector is armed if:
```
- The DISARM register is not set to the disarming bit pattern,^ and at least one of the following is true:

### ◦ The^ GLITCH_DETECTOR_EN^ OTP flag was programmed some time before the most recent reset of the OTP block

### ◦ The ARM register is set to an arming bit pattern

```
This holds the majority of the switched core domain in reset for approximately 120 microseconds before releasing the
reset. Specifically, this resets the PSM (Section 7.3), which resets all PSM-controlled resets starting with the processor
cold reset domain, in addition to all blocks reset by the RESETS block, which is itself reset by the PSM. The detector
circuits are also reset, as is the system watchdog including the watchdog scratch registers.
```
```
After a glitch detector-initiated reset, the CHIP_RESET.HAD_GLITCH_DETECT flag is set so that software can diagnose
that the last reset was caused by a glitch detector trigger. Check the TRIG_STATUS register to see which detector fired.
This can be useful for tuning the thresholds of individual detectors.
The only way to clear the detector circuits is to reset them, either via a full switched core domain reset (such as the RUN
pin, the SW-DP reset request, a PoR/BoR reset, or a reset of the switched core domain configured by POWMAN
controls), or by arming the glitch detector block so that the detectors reset along with the PSM.
Recovering from the glitch detector firing requires the low-power oscillator to be running (Section 8.4). Allowing the
```
10.9. Glitch detector 870

```
glitch detectors to fire when the LPOSC is disabled results in the chip holding itself in reset indefinitely until an external
reset such as the RUN pin resets the detectors.
```

## 10.10. Factory test JTAG

```
RP2350 contains JTAG hardware that is used to test devices after manufacturing. It is not a public interface, but its
capabilities are documented here for user risk assessment.
```
```
Much like the user-facing SWD debug, the JTAG interface is disabled at power-on, and enabled only once the OTP
power-on state machine has completed. If the CRIT1.SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE, CRIT1.SECURE_DEBUG_DISABLE or
CRIT1.DEBUG_DISABLE flag is set, then the JTAG interface remains held in reset indefinitely, so it cannot be
communicated with and cannot control internal hardware. The only way to re-enable the JTAG interface after setting
one of these critical flags is to set the RMA OTP flag (Section 10.11), which also permanently disables read and write
access to user OTP pages. The RMA flag itself is write-protected using the page 63 protection flags, so you can prevent
untrusted software from programming the RMA flag.
To take the JTAG interface out of reset, write to bit 0 of the RP-AP control register, accessed via SWD. To connect the
JTAG interface to GPIOs (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO on GPIO0 → 3), set bit 1 of the RP-AP control register. The RP-AP is always
accessible, even when external debug is disabled, because it is also used to enter the debug keys (Section 3.5.9.2).
However, attempts to remove the JTAG reset are ignored when any of the aforementioned critical OTP flags are set.
```
```
The JTAG interface provides:
```
- Standard test capabilities such as IDCODE and EXTEST (boundary scan); these are not guaranteed to be IEEE-
    compliant, as this is an internal factory test interface, not a user-facing debug port
- Full AHB bus access, with Secure and Privileged attributes and an HMASTER of 3 (debugger)
- Asynchronous access to a small subset of register controls, generally limited to clocks, oscillators and reset
    controls
The JTAG interface’s AHB bus access is muxed in place of the DMA read port, when the JTAG interface is enabled.

```
Any and all details of the factory test JTAG interface, with the exception of which OTP flags disable and re-enable it, are
subject to change with revisions of the RP2350 silicon.
```
## 10.11. Decommissioning

```
Devices returned to Raspberry Pi Ltd for fault analysis must be decommissioned before return, to restore factory test
functionality. A device is decommissioned by programming the OTP PAGE63_LOCK0.RMA flag to 1. Return may be
requested by Raspberry Pi Ltd when diagnosing systematic issues across a population of devices.
Setting the RMA flag has two effects:
```
- The factory test JTAG interface is re-enabled, irrespective of the values of any CRIT1 flags.
- Pages 3 through 61 become permanently inaccessible: this is all pages that do not have predefined contents listed
    in Section 13.10.

10.10. Factory test JTAG 874

```
The effect on OTP contents is as though all had been promoted to the inaccessible lock level:
```
- write attempts will fail
- read attempts will return all-ones, when read via an unguarded read alias, or bus faults, when read via a guarded
    read alias
The logic that disables OTP access and the logic that re-enables the test interface are driven from the same signal
internally, so this bit does not provide external access to user OTP contents, provided no sensitive material is stored in
pages 0, 1, 2, 62 or 63. Setting the RMA flag is irreversible, and may render the device permanently unusable, if it is
configured to boot from OTP contents stored in pages 3 through 61.

```
After setting the RMA flag, test the OTP access (e.g. via the SWD interface) and verify for yourself that any sensitive
data stored in OTP has been made inaccessible.
The page 63 lock word has no other function besides RMA because pages 62/63 contain the lock words themselves,
each of which is protected by its own permissions. This means the RMA flag can be write-protected by setting either a
hard or soft lock on page 63.
```
